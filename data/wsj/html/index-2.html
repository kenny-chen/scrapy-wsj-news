      <td>Investigators still don’t know how the company was breached in attack that will cost millions</td>
      <td>The newly appointed chief executive of  SolarWinds Corp.  is still trying to unravel how his company became a primary vector for hackers in a massive attack revealed last year, but said evidence is emerging that they were lurking in the company’s Office 365 email system for months.<br />The hackers had accessed at least one of the company’s Office 365 accounts by December 2019, and then leapfrogged to other Office 365 accounts used by the company, Sudhakar Ramakrishna said in an interview Tuesday. “Some email accounts were compromised. That led them to compromise other email accounts and as a result our broader [Office] 365 environment was compromised,” he said.<br />It is the latest development in the eight-week investigation into one of the worst breaches in U.S. history. SolarWinds, previously a little-known but critical maker of network-management software, is still trying to understand how the hackers first got into the company’s network and when exactly that happened.<br />One possibility is that the hackers may have compromised the company’s Office 365 accounts even earlier and then used that as the initial point of entry into the company, although that is one of several theories being pursued, Mr. Ramakrishna said.<br />Investigators are trying to determine how widespread the damage has been. So far only several dozen victims have been identified, but the attack could have ultimately affected close to 18,000 of the company’s customers.</td>

The drugmaker said its insurance companies have either disputed or declined to fully comply with their coverage obligations related to opioid-related litigation brought against Purdue.<br />The actual amount of insurance proceeds Purdue may wind up recovering will be determined in court, and claims made in the lawsuit will likely be challenged by the insurance companies. The lawsuit names several insurance companies, among them AIG Specialty Insurance Co. and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.<br />Purdue filed for chapter 11 protection in September 2019, with some support for a deal with creditors including states and municipalities to resolve claims for damages due to OxyContin’s alleged role in driving a nationwide epidemic of addiction that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.</td>

Tension with regulators and lawmakers has directly embroiled Mr. Bezos, who was called to testify in front of Congress last summer for the first time.<br />Mr. Bezos’s leadership of Amazon has made him one of the most respected, and feared, leaders in business, as well as fantastically wealthy.

      <td>Party leaders grapple with controversies over Marjorie Taylor Greene, Liz Cheney</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The top two Republicans in Congress are charting different courses after former President Donald Trump lost the White House but not his grip on much of the party.<br />Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has distanced himself from Mr. Trump and taken aim at what he sees as the GOP’s extremist fringe, while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has shored up his ties to the former president and urged members of his roiled caucus to stop attacking each other. Traditionally in lockstep, the leaders have rarely exposed such distance in their political calculations, as they contend with different intraparty divides on each side of the Capitol.<br />“Every party that loses the White House does a lot of blaming, finger-pointing and disarray, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said GOP strategist Terry Sullivan.<br />The debate centers on the direction of the party in the post-Trump era and the types of politicians it is willing to accept in its ranks, as it seeks to broaden its appeal in the electorate while not alienating voters loyal to Mr. Trump. The debate will continue Wednesday when the fate of two House members is expected to flare up at a House GOP meeting.<br />Mr. McConnell, who warned that disputing President Biden’s electoral victories could undermine democracy, hasn’t spoken with Mr. Trump since Dec. 15, the day after the Electoral College met. The Kentucky Republican harshly criticized Mr. Trump for his actions on the day of the Capitol riot, which led to his impeachment. He hasn’t yet said how he will vote in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial, although he reiterated Tuesday that he has concerns over its constitutionality now that Mr. Trump is no longer in office.</td>

      <td>Books can help calm and transport you from pandemic stress. But many of us are finding it harder to read now. Here’s how—and why—to get back to it.</td>
      <td>This past year, I’ve found myself returning again and again to a line of poetry by Emily Dickinson: “There is no frigate like a book.”<br />Like many people, I’ve needed the therapeutic effects of reading more than ever this year. As neuroscientists and psychologists (and your high school English teacher) will tell you: Books are good for the brain. And their benefits are particularly vital now. Books expand our world, providing an escape and offering novelty, surprise and excitement, which boost dopamine. They broaden our perspective and help us empathize with others. And they can improve our social life, giving us something to connect over.<br />Books can also distract us and help reduce our mental chatter. When we hit that glorious “flow state” of reading where we’re fully immersed in a book, our brain’s default mode network likely calms down, says Jud Brewer, a psychiatrist who directs research at Brown University’s Mindfulness Center. That’s a network of brain regions that is active when we are not doing anything else and that can get absorbed in worrying and rumination.<br />“There’s so much noise in the world right now and the very act of reading is a kind of meditation,” says Mitchell Kaplan, owner of the Miami-based independent bookstores Books & Books and co-founder of the Miami Book Fair. “You disconnect from the chaos around you. You reconnect with yourself when you are reading. And there’s no more noise.”<br />In 2020, the NPD Group recorded the best year of book sales since it began tracking comparable data in 2004. Sales of print books, which make up 80% of the market, were up 8.2% by volume over 2019, while sales of e-books were up 17%. The sales were driven by a number of categories, according to NPD book analyst Kristen McLean: children’s books; adult nonfiction, especially books about race and civil rights; and biography and memoir.</td>

Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the bill less than two hours later.<br />The existing law made it a violation for someone to remain or wander in a public place, beckoning or stopping people or vehicles for the purpose of prostitution. The number of people primarily charged with the offense has declined in the past 10 years to six in 2020 from 882 in 2010, according to the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services.<br />Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz, a Democrat from Queens, said she has transgender friends who were stopped by police “because of how they look and because they fit a certain profile.” She said she had been detained by police three times while walking in her home borough late at night, under suspicion of engaging in prostitution.</td>

Well, the science says schools can safely reopen, but the White House is still listening, make that bowing, to the non-scientists who run the teachers unions.<br />Mr. Biden has set a goal of reopening schools in his first 100 days, and the current union standoff in Chicago is his first big test. Elementary and middle school teachers there have refused to show up to classrooms as ordered. So the district has postponed reopening schools for two days. “We are practically begging [Chicago Teachers Union] to come to the table so we can get a deal done,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said.<br />No kidding. The district has surrendered to most union demands, which include allowing 5,000 or so employees to work from home because they have underlying health conditions. It has also spent $100 million on personal protective equipment, disinfectants, ventilation improvements, and portable air purifiers, and it will provide regular testing and contact tracing.<br />Yet now the union wants the district to let other staff work remotely if they wish and vaccinate teachers before they return to classrooms. If Chicago agrees to that, other unions would howl.<br />Ms. Lightfoot has been far too accommodating to the union, though she deserves credit for pushing at last to resume in-person learning. Large school districts in California including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Fresno have surrendered and are resisting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s exhortations to reopen.</td>

      <td>Minorities in the House of Representatives are rarely relevant, but the current GOP minority is only a few seats from taking back control. That makes its deliberations Wednesday over two of its Members an important message about the party’s potential return to power.<br />A few dozen backbenchers want to depose Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney from the House leadership for voting to impeach Donald Trump. Other Members are concerned about the high public profile of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a freshman Member from Georgia with kooky views. If the House GOP punishes Ms. Cheney while saying nothing about Ms. Greene, it will deserve a longer time in the wilderness.<br />Ms. Cheney’s impeachment decision was a vote of conscience, as GOP leaders said at the time. She joined nine others in voting to impeach Mr. Trump after an assault on the Capitol that followed weeks of false election claims from the White House. Some Republicans say Ms. Cheney has special obligations to reflect the GOP conference as a leader, but GOP leaders didn’t whip the vote and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was offering little guidance.<br />Ms. Cheney should get credit for daring to stand alone despite the political risks. The Trumpians are vowing to defeat her in a primary in 2022, and Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Trump acolyte, flew to a rally in Cheyenne last week to stir up opposition. Donald Trump Jr. called into the rally to promote a primary challenge to her in 2022.<br />If bowing before all things Trump is the litmus test for being a loyal Republican, the party should get used to continued losses in the suburbs. Mr. McCarthy should be defending his colleague’s vote as a matter of principle, even if he disagreed with it, rather than living in fear of the wrath of Mar-a-Lago.</td>

The opposition politician nearly died, but the assassination attempt by Russian spooks has made him an even more prominent threat to the Russian dictator’s rule.<br />The Kremlin had Mr. Navalny arrested upon his return to Russia in January after several months of treatment in Germany, and on Tuesday a Russian court sentenced him to three-and-a-half years in prison (reduced by one year for time served). The charges of violating his parole from a previous conviction are a farce. This is a political arrest and sentence.<br />One lesson is that Mr. Putin and his gang must feel threatened. Protests in support of Mr. Navalny have been growing in major Russian cities. Mr. Putin has survived protests before, notably in 2012, but his popularity has sagged amid an economy weakened by lower oil prices and Western sanctions.<br />“[Putin’s] only method is killing people,” Mr. Navalny said in court. “For as much as he pretends to be a great geopolitician, he’ll go down in history as a poisoner.”<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a strong statement urging the Kremlin to “immediately and unconditionally release” Mr. Navalny and others arrested during the recent protests. But Mr. Putin will only be impressed if the Biden Administration can marshal a unified Western response that includes tougher sanctions, including against Kremlin cronies.</td>

The effect is to equate everyone who doesn’t believe a man can transform into a woman by wishing it with George Wallace and Bull Connor.

      <td>Amazon CEO’s transition comes following stellar performance—and ahead of big challenges</td>
      <td>There was never going to be an ideal time for Jeff Bezos to go. But now is probably as good as it is going to get.<br />“Go” is a relative term.  Amazon.com  took pains on Tuesday to point out that its famous founder isn’t really leaving. The company used the occasion of its fourth-quarter report to announce that Mr. Bezos is handing over the chief executive reins to Andy Jassy—a longtime lieutenant who has been running the company’s AWS cloud business since its inception. Mr. Bezos will become executive chair of the company, with the transition taking place in the third quarter of this year.<br />Still, it is a big move. Even in a tech industry that accords founders near mythic status, Mr. Bezos was in a world of his own.  Facebook  is the only other of the big tech giants still being actively managed by its founder, and Mr. Bezos was already a decade into his job when Mark Zuckerberg came up with the idea of the social network in his Harvard dorm. With 2020 revenue totaling about $386 billion, Amazon is also now more than four times the size of Facebook by that metric, and much larger than Apple,  Microsoft  or Google ever got under the management of their respective founders.<br />Still, a transition someday was inevitable—especially for a 57-year-old billionaire who likes to dabble in rockets, newspapers and life sciences. There likely won’t be a better time: Amazon just wrapped a year where its already strong businesses were boosted by the pandemic, which fueled both online shopping and demand for cloud-computing services. Fourth-quarter revenue and operating earnings blew past Wall Street’s estimates. Full-year sales surged 38%—the company’s best growth rate since 2011, when annual sales were about one-eighth their current level.<br />At the same time, the company faces an unprecedented number of challenges, especially as lawmakers and regulators crack down on big tech. Amazon is also unique among its big tech peers in that front-line workers make up such a big portion of its employee base, which now numbers nearly 1.3 million. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, told reporters Tuesday that Mr. Bezos will remain “very involved”—especially on so-called “one-way door decisions” that are difficult to undo. That helped Amazon’s share price recover in after-hours trading, following an initial drop on the news. Even for a company seeming to fire on all cylinders, investors don’t seem ready to let Jeff Bezos blast off quite yet.</td>

      <td>Disposable real per capita income rose 5.5% in 2020, the highest rate since 1984, due largely to transfer payments.</td>
      <td>Even among economists who strongly support President Biden, a consensus is growing that the economy emerged from last year set for a robust recovery. That view has been espoused by Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Barack Obama’s former top economist Jason Furman. Both have expressed concern that the economy may overheat.<br />The most encouraging sign that recovery will be strong as the vaccines take hold is not that real gross domestic product rose 7.5% in the third quarter, offsetting 83% of the economic collapse produced by the shutdown in the preceding quarter. Nor is it that 16 million of the 22 million jobs lost have been restored. The most encouraging sign is how much the total purchasing power of American families has expanded during the crisis, reaching record highs.<br />To be sure, many Americans have taken a serious hit: Commerce Department data show total employee compensation in the second and third quarters of 2020 was down by $215 billion compared with the first quarter. Yet government personal transfers were up $893 billion—four times the compensation lost. In the second quarter alone, real per capita disposable income was up 10.5% compared with the first quarter—25 times as fast as the average quarterly income growth in the prior two years.<br />This surge in personal income was driven by government stimulus equal to $2.6 trillion, more than all the private wages and salaries paid in the first quarter of 2020. While preliminary fourth-quarter figures show that personal income declined from the previous quarter, real per capita disposable income in 2020 grew 5.5%—the highest growth rate since 1984, the peak of the Reagan recovery. All of this occurred before the $900 billion December stimulus took effect.<br />So what happened to all that money? As transfer payments surged in the second quarter and the shutdown curtailed personal-consumption expenditures, pent-up purchasing power spiked. Quarterly savings rose by almost $800 billion. The historical savings rate of 7% to 8% of income reached an astonishing 26% in the second quarter. Preliminary data for 2020 show total savings for 2020 was $1.6 trillion higher than in 2019. And that was before the $900 billion stimulus.</td>

When is he going to realize that his goals of racial unification and racial favoritism are at cross-purposes?<br />Last week Mr. Biden signed an executive order on “racial equity.” He said that George Floyd’s death last summer “marked a turning point in this country’s attitude toward racial justice” and is “forcing us to confront systemic racism and white supremacy.” He added that “this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equity” and make it “not just an issue for any one department. It has to be the business of the whole government.”<br />Nothing quickens the pulse of progressives like talk of “systemic racism” and “white supremacy,” so it’s hard to know if Mr. Biden is just telling leftists what they want to hear. But if it’s more than that—if the president is serious about focusing on equal outcomes instead of equal opportunities—then heaven help us. Milton Friedman said the “society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither,” while “the society that puts freedom before equality will end up with a great measure of both.” Of course, Friedman had a constrained view of the government’s capabilities that isn’t shared by very many Democrats today. For them, good intentions are what matter most.<br />The political left has long used racism as an all-purpose explanation for racial disparities. This ignores that disparities down through history have been the norm, not the exception, and that they exist even in regions of the world where most people are of the same race. The per capita income gap between people in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, for example, is wider than the gap between whites and blacks in the U.S. Moreover, racial disparities have both grown and narrowed over time, even though racism has been constant. If Mr. Biden wants to change the government’s approach to racial inequality, this history ought to inform his actions.<br />The greatest success of the civil-rights movement wasn’t a new government program but getting government off the backs of blacks by defeating Jim Crow. Nothing the government has done since then in the name of advancing blacks has been more effective than simply ending government-sponsored discrimination. Black poverty fell by 40 percentage points between 1940 and 1960. It continued to decline in the wake of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society interventions, but at a much slower pace.</td>

      <td>IMF ‘special drawing rights’ with no strings are the wrong way to help developing countries.</td>
      <td>Sometimes an idea gets legs in Washington that is so objectively bad, you’re almost tempted to admire it simply for beating the odds. Such is the case with left-wing claims that the International Monetary Fund must shower money on developing economies to beat Covid-19. Congressional Democrats have pushed repeatedly for time-sensitive “must pass” legislation to require the IMF to issue at least two trillion special drawing rights, or SDRs, to its 190 member countries, which governments could then exchange for nearly $3 trillion in hard currency to defend against the pandemic.<br />This isn’t what SDRs are for, and it’s almost certainly not how they would be used if Democrats in Congress got their wish. Under the IMF’s longstanding rules, SDRs are supposed to meet a “long-term global need” in reserves; they aren’t meant to arm countries for short-term spending emergencies.<br />Nor would that be feasible: There are no strings attached to how a government uses SDRs, and they never have to be repaid. Donor countries may want recipient states to focus on acquiring personal protective equipment, vaccines and the like, but the IMF and World Bank already have programs directing money to areas where it’s needed most. A blank check would surrender accountability for how the money is used, inviting waste and corruption.<br />Another likely scenario is that SDRs would eventually go to pay debts to the Chinese government, as well as to private creditors who piled into risky debt before the coronavirus emerged. As the foremost creditor to the developing world, Beijing has fought multilateral agreements to suspend poor nations’ debt repayments during the pandemic, only yielding in small ways. China has also resisted pressure from the U.S. and allies for greater transparency on its predatory lending terms. Lavishing SDRs on developing-world borrowers would make restructuring or forgiveness of Chinese government loans less likely, giving Beijing the green light to proceed with business as usual in a post-pandemic world. No wonder Yi Gang, governor of China’s central bank, has championed the cause of issuing more SDRs from the IMF.<br />It gets worse. Since the IMF must allocate SDRs to countries according to their shareholding weight in the organization, the neediest would be the least able to benefit. A rich IMF member like the Netherlands would receive more than three times as much as Nigeria. Or consider that New Zealand, despite having virtually eliminated Covid-19 on its shores, would be entitled to more SDRs than Congo. The fine citizens of Luxembourg, population 600,000, would get more than the 163 million Bangladeshis. The perverse examples go on and on.</td>

      <td>Robinhood might remind its customers that stocks are about something real.</td>
      <td>With the  GameStop  bubble coming to its foreordained conclusion on Tuesday the broader stock market was having its best day in a while. Internet progress is sometimes measured in pratfalls. The stumble of the free online brokerage Robinhood over its customers’ trading of GameStop actually hearkens to a precedent that has nothing to do with the Wall Street vs. little guy narrative that preoccupies some.<br />In 1996, dial-up internet pioneer America Online stopped charging by the hour in favor of a flat monthly fee. Unsurprisingly, customers instantly revealed a preference for being online all the time. But a symphony of busy signals exposed an unappreciated fact of AOL’s business model: It was reselling access to the regulated local phone system designed for calls that last six minutes, not all week.<br />Robinhood could give small-timers free brokerage because it was selling their order flow, and thus information about which stocks were in demand, to other intermediaries. This model worked until its customers drove GameStop to unrealistic heights for reasons of their own. Then a behind-the-scenes plumbing provider, Robinhood’s clearing agent, spoke up. It would not accept the risk of the brokerage or its customers failing to deliver the cash if prices collapsed during the hours or days before trades cleared. It demanded Robinhood put up collateral it didn’t have. So Robinhood curtailed its customers to buying just a single share of GameStop.<br />Boom. Suddenly conspiracy theories flowed about Wall Street biggies intervening to stop a phenomenon that had harmed their own bets that GameStop would fall (known as short selling).<br />Like AOL’s, Robinhood’s snafu was partly due to ancient, clunky infrastructure—in this case for certifying ownership of an asset, such as a share of stock or even a person’s ownership of his or her own identity. (Blockchain is the answer many have proposed just as broadband solved the AOL problem.)</td>

      <td>There are so many diet programs to choose from—but do any of them work? One man’s try-anything search for a slimmer self.</td>
      <td>In the past two decades, one dimension of U.S. public health has undergone a shocking transformation: body weight. In 2000, the residents of West Virginia had an obesity rate of 23.9%, the highest of any U.S. state. By 2019, Colorado had nearly the same rate (23.8%), and it was the lowest of any state. Leaving aside a few small nations, the United States is the fattest country in the world, with an adult obesity rate exceeding 42%.<br />The disease and disability that accompany excess weight have contributed to higher health-care costs and lower life expectancy. They’ve also created a $72 billion industry devoted to telling people how to shed extra pounds. These combined conditions—reasons to worry and strategies to manage—set the stage for Barry Estabrook’s “Just Eat,” an enlightening first-person account focused on the diets that Americans attempt to follow and the cultures that seem to have found a healthy relationship with food.<br />Mr. Estabrook’s chronicle begins with his getting a physical—and admitting to himself that he is 40 pounds overweight. He is saddled with high cholesterol, so his doctor ups the dosage of a drug to treat it—to the maximum permissible level. But with high blood pressure, a family history of heart disease and a self-image as “lumpy,” Mr. Estabrook sees that something more is needed: He decides to go on the first diet of his life.<br />While his journalistic background includes food writing (he’s a former editor of Eating Well magazine), Mr. Estabrook poses as a dietary Everyman: no expert scientific or medical knowledge and no investment in any one regimen: “I had no horse in the race other than my rotund belly.” He believes that, if he can find a way of losing weight after an adulthood “defined by chubbiness and a spotty record in the willpower department,” then “anyone could.”<br />But he’s candid about the challenge he faces, citing studies showing that few people succeed by using diets to achieve long-term weight loss—and a lot of dieters end up adding weight. “In many ways,” he writes, “dieting is a multibillion-dollar scam.” Still, he gives it a try.</td>

Their investment of massive airtime certainly paid off, as the Trump era turned out to be a golden age for political controversy and news-like programming.<br />Back in 2015, staff at the two networks were likely happy to enlist in the Trump promotion project because they figured he was the Republican most likely to lose to Hillary Clinton.

No date has yet been set for that vote, a committee spokeswoman said.<br />Proposals to change agricultural practices are one piece of Mr. Biden’s push to tackle climate change, which was on display in three executive orders issued last week suspending new oil and gas leases on federal land and boosting offshore wind production.

The scaffold doesn’t control the shape or style of the building and it eases its support as the structure rises.<br />Here are edited excerpts from an interview:<br />Many families are struggling during the pandemic. How does parenting need to change?<br />Self-care is so essential. Self-care is child care, particularly during Covid.

      <td>FOR STIR-crazed Americans wrestling with the virus and its variants while awaiting the vaccine, the dream of roaming pedal-to-the-medal across the continent is a transfixing one. “In quarantine you’re not just stuck in a place physically, you’re stuck mentally, and travel opens up your thoughts,” said Chicago photographer Jasmin Shah who made several cross-country trips last year. Whatever the inspiration, be it Sacagawea, Kerouac or “Thelma & Louise,” it’s still possible to conduct an epic cross-country road trip during the pandemic. But do plenty of research before heading out the door. Think about “snacks, water, cleaning supplies and stops,” said Paula Twidale, senior vice-president of travel at the American Automobile Association (AAA), who ticked off a list of precautions to consider. “You need to plan ahead to have freedom and flexibility.” Covid-19 restrictions, quarantines, openings and closings change frequently so check them often. AAA, for example, posts such information on the organization’s travel planning site triptik.aaa.com. Ms. Twidale’s team of travel planners outline three memorable trips:<br />Crossing the continent via Interstates 80 and 90 would take 42 hours straight through, but Ms. Twidale cautions travelers not to rush the 2,852-mile-long route. Bisecting 11 states, the journey offers plenty to see and do. The route includes urban layovers in Cleveland, with a visit to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and Chicago for its deep-dish pizza (locals like delivery from Lou Malnati’s) with a stop by Lake Michigan. In South Dakota, visit the town of Mitchell and its Corn Palace. From Montana, a short southern detour to Wyoming will deliver you to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, before finally ending by Puget Sound in Seattle and a visit to the Space Needle. (Amazon’s twin Spheres, however, are closed.)<br />Any list of cross-country trips should include Route 66, the country’s “Mother Road” between the Midwest and California before the Interstate Highway System. “It’s going back in time,” Ms. Twidale said about making the 2,448-mile-long drive. AAA’s recommended stops include iconic monuments like the St. Louis Gateway Arch and quirky roadside attractions like Illinois’s 1924 Ariston Café, or the Cadillac Ranch art installation in Amarillo, Tex. In Arizona slight detours will take you to Grand Canyon and Petrified Forest national parks and if you need a respite, sleep over in Holbrook’s Wigwam Motel. In California you’ll pass near the desert wilds of Joshua Tree and Death Valley national parks before concluding the trip in Los Angeles at the Santa Monica Pier on the Pacific Ocean. Order a celebratory takeout meal at nearby local favorite Chez Jay.<br />This 2,032-mile-long road trip features stops along the U.S. Civil Rights Trail, a collection of destinations in 16 mostly southern states and Washington, D.C., that highlight Black Americans’ fight for justice, and concludes in Denver. Begin at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Washington near the Lincoln Memorial, location of his 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech. Stop in Greensboro, N.C., the city famous for its Woolworth lunch counter sit-ins. In Memphis, Tenn., see the Lorraine Motel, part of the National Civil Rights Museum, and site of Dr. King’s assassination. In Topeka, Kan., explore the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site commemorating the 1954 Supreme Court ruling that began the country’s desegregation efforts. In Colorado, visit the Black American West Museum (temporarily closed) and take a walking tour of Five Points, Denver’s historic Black neighborhood. Once the “Harlem of the West,” it’s now filled with galleries, restaurants and microbreweries.<br />Carry pandemic precautions including extra masks, hand sanitizer, disposable gloves for pumping gas, and check openings and closures before arrival.</td>

      <td>Company is planning new games featuring real schools—but without the names or likenesses of specific athletes</td>
      <td>Electronic Arts Inc.  plans to bring back college football videogames after it stopped making them years ago amid a legal battle over the use of student-athletes’ names and images. Yet the return comes with a twist, the company says: the new games, for now, will feature real teams, but not specific players, in a bet that gamers will care more about the name on the front of the jersey than those on the back.<br />EA’s intention to re-enter the college-sports arena comes in the middle of a complex debate involving Congress, state legislatures and the National Collegiate Athletic Association over how and whether to compensate student-athletes.<br />Under a deal announced Tuesday with collegiate-trademark company CLC, EA is gaining exclusive rights to make games that simulate U.S. college football. Game development work is just getting started, the company said, so it could take a few years before any new title comes to market.<br />EA has secured the rights to team logos, uniforms and other college game-day traditions, a company spokesman said. EA, for now, isn’t planning to include player names or likenesses in new games due to uncertainty around rules from the NCAA, the largest nonprofit body supervising U.S. college sports, the spokesman said. The NCAA currently restricts third parties from using those attributes but that could soon change as the organization has committed to rewriting its bylaws amid pressure from high-profile litigation and state legislation.<br />The announcement comes as EA is slated to release its quarterly financial report after markets close today. Analysts expect the company to show strong growth in its business as the pandemic continues to fuel demand for at-home entertainment, after markets close today.</td>

      <td>The deadly nerve agent was developed in the Soviet Union</td>
      <td>Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny was sentenced to serve about 3½ years in prison following his return from Germany where he was transported after a near fatal poisoning attempt last August. Prosecutors had requested that a suspended sentence Mr. Navalny received in 2014 be turned into real prison time, for what authorities said was repeated violations of the terms of his parole, including when he was recuperating in a Berlin hospital. The 3½-year sentence credits the time Mr. Navalny served under house, leaving him to serve 32 months behind bars. European authorities say Novichok, a military-grade chemical nerve agent, was used in the attack against the political activist.<br />It is a deadly nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union and then Russia as a more potent and harder-to-detect alternative to VX and soman. Its existence was first revealed in the early 1990s by a dissident scientist as Moscow prepared to enter the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention to end the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons.<br />Novichok is carried in two parts that are combined to create a viscous liquid just before it is administered—making it difficult to detect. It disrupts the way nerve cells communicate with each other, interfering with muscle control and potentially causing respiratory and cardiac arrest. Once deployed, it remains dangerous in the environment for months, if not longer.<br />They include breathlessness, muscle pain, nausea and vomiting, incontinence and mental confusion.<br />The most effective treatment for Novichok poisoning is atropine, which is derived from the belladonna plant, or deadly nightshade. It isn’t a cure, but if applied quickly it can block the effects of nerve agents. Soldiers likely to be attacked with chemical weapons often carry supplies to inject into their thighs.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—A Russian court sentenced Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to 3½ years in prison, but gave credit for about a year already served, sidelining the country’s most prominent opposition politician and likely fueling a burgeoning protest movement triggered by his detention last month.<br />Mr. Navalny, who was kept in a glass cage throughout the hearing, laughed to himself as the judge read the lengthy verdict. He drew a heart with his finger and looked at his wife, Yulia, as the judge neared the end of the sentencing.<br />During his testimony, the opposition politician blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for a poisoning attack against him last year and called the court proceedings against him an act of cowardice. Striking at the image of Mr. Putin as a master strategist, he said the Kremlin leader never fought his enemies fairly.<br />“[Putin’s] only method is killing people,” Mr. Navalny said. “For as much as he pretends to be a great geopolitician, he’ll go down in history as a poisoner.”<br />Following the verdict, Mr. Navalny’s supporters called for people to take to a central square near the Kremlin, where riot police, with shields and batons, had already assembled. By late evening, police had already detained some protesters there.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Capt. Tom Moore, a British military veteran who shot to fame last year after raising millions of pounds for charity by walking lengths of his garden during lockdown, has died at age 100 after contracting the coronavirus.<br />Capt. Moore’s family said on Twitter that he had been fighting pneumonia and had tested positive for the coronavirus in January. During the last year, the World War II veteran became a mascot for a British nation plagued by Covid-19, raising millions for health workers, recording a No. 1 single, publishing a book and being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his efforts.<br />His arrival on the public stage happened almost by accident. After Britain went into lockdown last spring, he announced a sponsored walk round the garden in his home in Marston Moretaine just north of London. Age 99, he planned to walk a hundred lengths of the garden and raise £1,000—about $1,365—for charities linked to the National Health Service. The quest became an internet sensation. He raised almost £33 million.<br />“For all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment: The sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away,” said Capt. Moore after completing his walk.<br />Queen Elizabeth II paid tribute to Capt. Moore, “recognising the inspiration he provided for the whole nation and others across the world.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said “in the face of this country’s deepest postwar crisis he united us all, he cheered us all up, and he embodied the triumph of the human spirit.” A Union Jack above Downing Street was flown at half-mast.</td>

      <td>Fashion insiders share their favorite eco-conscious labels and how they’re making a difference</td>
      <td>NEXT TO sweatpants and Zoom shirts, sustainability might be the hottest thing in fashion right now. Consumers—especially younger ones—increasingly expect more from the brands they patronize: more transparency, more accountability, more emphasis on ethical practices. You should, however, take any brand’s claims that its products are “sustainable” with a grain of salt. “Sustainable” is a vague, catch-all term that can be exploited for marketing purposes. A brand that sells only locally produced clothes made from recycled fabric can use the word—but so can one that works with harmful chemicals yet occasionally releases a limited run of vegan-leather shoes. “It’s like saying food is ‘natural.’ It’s very broad,” said Kayla Gil, owner and curator of Seattle’s Pipe & Row boutique. That doesn’t mean that shoppers hoping to lighten their carbon footprints should give up—it just means they should do a little homework.<br />Experts encourage customers hoping to shop more eco-consciously to go beyond the claims on a brand’s website and to research the brand’s track record and goals via articles from reliable news outlets and independent platforms like stand.earth, a climate watchdog organization, or Greenpeace’s Detox campaign, which tracks fashion brands’ use of hazardous chemicals. “Today, I just don’t think you can have a fashion brand without being responsible,” said Julie Gilhart, the chief development officer of fashion consulting firm Tomorrow Ltd, who has worked in the fashion industry for more than 20 years. “But there are lots of different levels: [Brands and designers] who are more advanced in their knowledge; some that are just learning how to change things; some that are just beginning. Make sure that there’s an intention to grow their responsibility. And if they have none, move to another brand.”<br />We asked four fashion insiders to spotlight brands that are legitimately striving for eco-consciousness and delivering on their promises. Learn about their favorites, below.<br />Founder of Gil Rodriguez<br />I love the Paris-based brand Tricot. They do really classic pieces out of recycled cashmere and the quality is beautiful. I look at sustainability from the perspective of buying less. Treating clothing as disposable, regardless of how it’s made is still incredibly wasteful. I focus on buying vintage things that have already had a life and then picking up a great new basic that I’ll wear for a long time.</td>

      <td>The continent wanted to teach the world a lesson in solidarity. Now its vaccination plan is falling apart.</td>
      <td>As Western governments faced criticism for their pandemic management last summer, European Union officials began work on a vaccine-procurement plan they hoped would put the continent at the forefront of efforts to banish the coronavirus and reopen economies.<br />Instead of its 27 member states fighting for doses from a few manufacturers, the European Commission, the closest the bloc has to a government, would centralize purchases for some 450 million inhabitants, bringing prices down and ensuring that residents of rich and poor countries alike would get equal access to the best shots available.<br />Half a year later, an acute shortage of doses is keeping the EU’s vaccination effort from taking off, making it likely that only a small portion of the general public will get a shot by the end of summer. The reasons: The EU was late in ordering vaccines compared with the U.S. and the U.K.; it bet on companies that have yet to deliver; and when delays started creeping in, it blamed the manufacturers instead of restarting negotiations.<br />“There are about 10 hard weeks of vaccine deficiency ahead of us,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn told journalists over the weekend. “More [vaccines] could have been ordered, and faster.”<br />Israel has vaccinated 55% of its population, the U.K. 14% and the U.S. 9.4%, against just 2.8% for the EU. At current rates, only two members, Malta and Romania, will have immunized one-third of their population by the end of the year, according to a Jan. 29 report by UBS.</td>

      <td>Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek star as an unlikely duo on a drug-induced quest to prove that their world is a simulation in this sci-fi film written and directed by Mike Cahill.</td>
      <td>Writer-directorMike Cahill’s 2011 “Another Earth” was a tantalizing feature, in large part because its sci-fi elements orbited at an oblique angle: The heart of the story was recklessness, tragedy and a young woman’s need for redemption. Only tangentially did it involve an alternative planet, a parallel reality and a correctable past. It was off-handedly fantastic, thus plausible. It was everything “Bliss” is not.<br />Directed by Mr. Cahill from his own screenplay, the Amazon Original “Bliss” stars Owen Wilson as Greg Wittle, an employee of a company called Technical Difficulties (“We’re sorry you’re having technical difficulties,” hundreds of employees recite into hundreds of phones). This by itself is not a harbinger of good news, nor is it particularly subtle: As becomes clear very quickly, Greg is malfunctioning. His wife has recently kicked him out. His daughter, Emily (Nesta Cooper), is inviting him to her graduation, which he’s reluctant to attend. He’s been feigning various physical injuries, it appears, and has run out of opioid refills (as he’s told by an impatient pharmacist). The boss wants to see him, right away; he crushes a pill into snortable form before answering the summons.<br />We sympathize with his plight, but we also see soon enough why his fellow employees might hate him. Which they quite obviously do.<br />Mr. Cahill gives us Greg on the cusp of a meltdown, with his life collapsing in two directions at once—homeless criminality on the one hand, intoxicated euphoria on the other. Fleeing his office, where things have gone terribly wrong, he visits the corner bar—Plato’s Dive, not insignificantly—where he meets the magically unreal Isabel Clemens (Salma Hayek). A much-tattooed, ornately attired street person—or witch, or prostitute with a drug habit similar to Greg’s—Isabel can control people and things with a wave of her hand, or so it seems. And she informs Greg that while they occupy a “real” reality, most of what they’re seeing isn’t there at all. They need to procure more of the enchanted amber crystals they ingest “in order to exit this stupid simulation.” Much of their time is occupied in doing just that and flitting from skid row to paradise. The viewer, meanwhile, is wondering why he should buy into any of it.<br />Mr. Wilson has always seemed congenitally sardonic and Ms. Hayek, quite game given the material, is a comedian at heart. So neither seems wholly committed to the seriousness of “Bliss”—and if the story isn’t serious, what is it? As it irreparably slips the cumbersome bonds of reality, entering a drug-induced world where dosage determines action and location, it seems to be a parable about addiction, while also suggesting that if one had enough drugs one could permanently exist in a state of bliss. As this cannot happen, Greg’s story is just terribly sad, in a way that all the hallucinations in his head can’t make more palatable for the viewer.</td>

      <td>The expert class will continue to create their opinions within their own bubble of reinforcing data, leaving a wide open political landscape for those willing to venture beyond those self-imposed constraints.</td>
      <td>Barton Swaim’s “Trump and the Failure of the Expert Class” (op-ed, Jan. 23) describes how the “experts” got it wrong in 2016 because they were totally out of touch with the average American and misread the mood of the voter. The flashing light that should have been a signal to the pollsters, consultants and political pundits was the consistent 30%, plus or minus, support for Bernie Sanders and similar support for Donald Trump throughout the Democratic and Republican primaries. The conclusion to be drawn was that approximately 60% of all Americans were fed up with the establishment “business as usual” political system and were looking for drastic change either in the form of a self-avowed socialist or populist. When Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination, it was no surprise that Bernie supporters either stayed home or voted for Donald Trump.<br />Mr. Swaim points out the inability of experts who “acknowledge no error,” leaving little doubt they will continue to misread the mood of the American people. According to a December 2020 Gallup poll, Congress’s approval rating was 15%, indicative of the public’s disdain for how the government is being run. Antifa-encouraged riots, continued strong support for Sen. Sanders and his agenda and the 2020 election results showing President Trump received more votes (including those of African-Americans and Latinos) than any previous Republican should be a wake-up call for the Republican Party. If Republicans want to be relevant in future elections, they should recognize Americans on both sides of the political spectrum are tired of the status quo, which isn’t working for them.<br />Members of the expert class will continue to create their opinions within their own bubble of reinforcing data, leaving a wide-open political landscape for those willing to venture beyond those self-imposed constraints.<br />Ken Dropek<br />Houston</td>

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Fossil-Fuel Freeze” (Jan. 23): The federal leasing system has been a mess for a long time. Overproduction and a glut in global oil markets has driven prices down and bankruptcies up since 2015—long before the pandemic. In other words, there is no urgency to lease more federal land for drilling, a course the Trump administration blindly pursued. Most lease sales have one bidder, many none at all. Leases often sell for $2 per acre. Millions of leased acres sit idle and will probably never enter production. In the recent, highly contentious Arctic National Wildlife Refuge lease sale, the biggest bidder was the state of Alaska, and no major oil producers submitted bids at all.<br />Moreover, royalties from mineral development on federal land have been an important revenue stream for western states like New Mexico. Yet the same 12.5% royalty rate has applied since 1920s, while oil-rich states like Texas charge as much as 25% for drilling on state lands.<br />The sky is not falling for the oil and gas industry, and there is neither a shortage of federal oil and gas leases nor a need for expanding production.<br />Autumn Hanna<br />Taxpayers for Common Sense</td>

      <td>Kraft Heinz Co.  is nearing a deal to sell its Planters snack business to Skippy peanut butter owner  Hormel Foods Corp. , according to people familiar with the matter.<br />A deal, valuing the century-old brand at around $3 billion, could be announced as soon as next week, assuming the talks don’t fall apart, the people said.<br />Planters primarily sells nuts and snack mixes, with labels featuring the tophat-wearing and monocled Mr. Peanut mascot.<br />In addition to its eponymous chili and deli meats, Austin, Minn.-based Hormel sells other grocery items and protein-centric foods including Skippy and Justin’s nut butters. The company, which has a market value of about $25 billion, has been an active acquirer in recent years as it diversifies. A deal for Planters would be by far its largest to date.<br />Kraft Heinz, the product of a 2015 merger of the two well-known food companies, has been divesting brands after it struggled to keep up with shifting consumer tastes. The maker of Heinz ketchup and Oscar Mayer deli meats said in September the strategy will help the company simplify its business and focus on its most promising brands.</td>

      <td>We assembled a panel of top meat purveyors to answer this question. Turns out it comes down to four simple steps.</td>
      <td>ANYONE WHO has ever lifted a skillet has an opinion on the wildly subjective matter of the best way to cook a steak. Some swear by the charcoal grill. Some geek out over their sous-vide setup. While chefs and home cooks alike love their techniques and gadgets, we thought the best people to ask are those who truly know meat. Enter our panel of butchers, five steak-savvy pros who assure us success lies in four easy steps—Nathan Abeyta from Deep Cuts, Dallas; Theotis Cason from Cason’s Fine Meats, Portland, Ore.; Nicholas Ponte and Sarah Welch from Marrow, Detroit; and Orlando Sanchez from Butcher Bar, New York City.<br />“The meat makes the meal!” according to Mr. Cason. Scoring the best cuts starts with striking up a conversation with your butcher. “Let us know if you want a fancy steak or an everyday steak. Ask our opinion,” Mr. Ponte advised. “Once we understand what you are looking for, we might go beyond what’s in the case and offer something extra special.” Be sure to share your personal tastes. Ms. Welch always asks customers, “Do you like lean cuts or fatty cuts? Grass-fed or grain-finished? These conversations are important in finding the best steak for you.” Smart shoppers should seek freshly cut meat with a deep rosy color and check for even marbling throughout fattier cuts.<br />Another great reason to talk to your butcher: They often share cooking tips, noting that some cuts are more foolproof than others. “I find that a steak that’s at least 1¼ to 1½ inches thick tends to be more forgiving when you cook it,” Mr. Abeyta said. Ms. Welch singles out tenderloin as a “low-risk” cut, while Mr. Cason points to skirt steak as particularly salvageable. “It cooks quick and easy, and if you overcook it you can cut it up and put it on a salad or use it in a stir-fry.”<br />For ingredients, all you need in addition to meat are salt, pepper and cooking fat. Ms. Welch advocates for cooking steak in beef tallow. “Its high smoke point allows it to conduct heat very well,” she said. Otherwise, the butchers recommend light oils such as avocado, canola or extra-light olive oil. Avoid regular olive oil as it burns on high heat and can add a bitter flavor to the meat.<br />Mr. Sanchez is a staunch endorser of obtaining and using an instant-read meat thermometer. “It really helps, especially for amateur cooks, to get the meat to the temperature you are seeking,” he said.</td>

      <td>Google’s YouTube has ratcheted up censorship to a new level by removing two videos from a U.S. Senate committee. They were from a Dec. 8 Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on early treatment of Covid-19. One was a 30-minute summary; the other was the opening statement of critical-care specialist Pierre Kory.<br />Dr. Kory is part of a world-renowned group of physicians who developed a groundbreaking use of corticosteroids to treat hospitalized Covid patients. His testimony at a May Senate hearing helped doctors rethink treatment protocols and saved lives.<br />At the December hearing, he presented evidence regarding the use of ivermectin, a cheap and widely available drug that treats tropical diseases caused by parasites, for prevention and early treatment of Covid-19. He described a just-published study from Argentina in which about 800 health-care workers received ivermectin and 400 didn’t. Not one of the 800 contracted Covid-19; 58% of the 400 did.<br />Dr. Kory asked the National Institutes of Health to review his group’s manuscript outlining dozens of successful trials and to consider updating its Aug. 27 guidance in which it recommended “against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19, except in a clinical trial.” On Dec. 10, Sen. Rand Paul and I sent a letter to the NIH requesting that it review Dr. Kory’s evidence.<br />On Jan. 14, NIH changed its guidance to neutral by acknowledging the successful trials but determined “that currently there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19.” On Jan. 22 I sent an oversight letter asking what actions the NIH had taken to explore the use of repurposed drugs for treating Covid-19.</td>

      <td>The best shot at a bipartisan bill is focusing on relief, not structural change.</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 relief bill is the first test for the Biden administration. It’s no surprise there’s disagreement on how to proceed. One controversy is strategic: How vigorously should the administration pursue bipartisan support for its legislation, and what price should it be willing to pay to achieve it? Some Democrats—myself among them—believe that the president’s calls for unity will be hollow unless he does all he can to reach a bipartisan agreement that satisfies his core objectives. Monday’s meeting with 10 Republican senators to discuss their $618 billion offer was a good first step, and conversations will continue.<br />In the end compromise may be out of reach, and Mr. Biden could be forced to depend on Democratic votes. Then the question will be if the arcane congressional process of “budget reconciliation” is compatible with political reconciliation. The optimists hope that the president can start with one-party government and shift to bipartisanship later; the pessimists fear that early partisanship will poison the well for the next two years. I believe that the preponderance of the evidence supports the pessimists, but Mr. Biden will have to make a tough call.<br />The other controversy is over policy: What does an adequate response to the pandemic require? Nearly everyone agrees that the federal government should do more to help states and localities vaccinate their populations as quickly as possible. Most agree on money for more testing, personal protective equipment, and treatments for those who contract Covid-19. More assistance for small businesses also enjoys broad support, despite doubts from economists that such programs are an effective and efficient use of public resources.<br />But then agreement breaks down. The Senate Republican plan meets the administration’s funding request for vaccinations and other health-related measures, but offers less for extended unemployment payments, aid to schools, and checks to individuals. It doesn’t increase the child tax credit and provides no direct aid to states and localities. But even this may be too much for House Republicans.<br />Step back from the details, and it’s clear the administration proposals serve four distinct policy objectives: relief, stimulus, investment and structural change. The details matter, but measures to mitigate immediate hardship enjoy the broadest support. Measures to promote economic and social change—such as increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour—are the least popular. Proposed investments for the future, such as rebuilding and restocking the National Strategic Stockpile, are also widely supported, in part because of their relatively modest cost.</td>

      <td>Lists of easy-care greenery always include the same species—from snake plant to rubber tree. We asked horticulturalists to recommend five handsome, no-brainer alternatives.</td>
      <td>THE INTERNET BRIMS with recommendations for houseplants that are tough to kill. But the same suggestions—ZZ plants, snake plants, rubber plants—crop up again and again. To break the botany monotony, we consulted horticulturalists who create and maintain plantscapes for office lobbies, hotels and other public spaces. Could they point us to less ubiquitous varieties that are just as low-care? “We prefer plants that are relatively drought-tolerant, pest-resistant and don’t frequently shed leaves,” said Louise Fair, a Seattle-area interior landscaper. Here, five examples of no-fuss flora that stand out from the crowd.<br />Philodendrons thrive in bright, indirect light, and they need water only once a week. For a twist on the typical heart-shaped leaf on tendril stems, consider the Philodendron selloum variety, said Katy McEvoy, a San Francisco plant pro whose clients include Google and YouTube. She likes how architectural and exotic its dark, deeply lobed and ripple-edged leaves are. Selloum can reach 5 feet tall, ideal for cultivating drama in a living-room corner. “I love how they grow up and arching, like a Vegas showgirl’s headpiece,” she said.<br />Classic Monsteras, with their glossy split leaves and chill Mexican vibes, have shown up in recent years on wallpapers, phone cases and everything in between. Less clichéd is the Monstera adansonii, which has holes instead of splits and an adorable nickname: the Monkey Mask. “I lean toward plants that add drama or create a moment,” said New York interior landscaper Luke Norden, whose clients include Fresh Direct’s headquarters in the Bronx. “Monstera adansonii is so sculptural, and it’s incredibly easy to grow—especially in indirect light—making it ideal for New York apartments.”<br />You know the snake plant (scientific name: Sansevieria trifasciata). You probably have a snake plant. Your cousin probably has one. So does your dentist’s waiting room. Ms. McEvoy likes this other member of the family, the Sansevieria starfish. Its chubby, tubular leaves taper to a point and splay, unlike its rigidly vertical relative, making it a fun choice. “I use it in designs when I want to release my inner punk rocker,” she said. It will grow in any light, and generally needs water every other week—even once a month.<br />Of the fiddle-leaf fig tree, Ms. McEvoy said, “It’s been done to death.” Ficus audrey, an oval-leafed sister plant and much-less-finicky alternative, “has a striking silhouette and deep green, white-veined leaves.” While audreys love bright light, they’re forgiving of filtered light. They’re also more tolerant of a less-consistent watering schedule.</td>

But he left limited room for negotiation on issues such as human rights, the coronavirus response and what he called U.S. interference in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang.<br />“These issues concern China’s core interests, national dignity, as well as the sensitivities of its 1.4 billion people,” Mr. Yang said in a video address to the National Committee on United States-China Relations in New York. “They constitute a red line which must not be crossed.”<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken had in an interview that aired hours earlier on MSNBC criticized China for having broken its promises on Hong Kong’s autonomy and handling of the Covid-19 outbreak with a lack of transparency.<br />Mr. Blinken—whose message deviated little from that of his predecessor, Mike Pompeo—described China as a significant challenge to the U.S. but said strong alliances are an advantage for Washington in confronting China.</td>

Tuesday’s announcement marks the largest deal to date in the U.S. online alcohol space, according to the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America, a trade group representing more than 350 distributors.<br />Delivery has become an unexpected lifeline for Uber as the pandemic has hammered its core ride-hailing business. The company acquired food-delivery rival Postmates Inc. last year in a stock deal valued at $2.65 billion.<br />That combination made its Uber Eats business the second-largest food-delivery company in the U.S. after  DoorDash Inc.  Both companies have shored up their delivery offerings during the health crisis. Uber began delivering groceries in the U.S. and Canada last year, after acquiring Chilean startup Cornershop. DoorDash started delivering cleaning supplies and over-the-counter medicines from 7-Eleven convenience stores,  Walgreens  and CVS, among others.<br />The pandemic turbocharged online sales of alcohol, a category that has long lagged behind other consumer goods products in the U.S. and some other key markets due to strict regulations and entrenched consumer habits. E-commerce made up just 1% of U.S. alcohol sales by retailers in 2019 by volume but is expected to grow to 7% by 2024, says industry tracker IWSR.</td>

      <td>THE LATEST work-from-home indignity? Enduring attacks of the shivers in the poorly insulated spaces that we’ve converted into makeshift home offices.<br />“I got tired of wearing three or four layers on my video calls with clients,” said Lauren Cooney, a career strategy coach who’s been working from a freezing room in her Marin County, Calif., home. Though Ms. Cooney tried to power through the chill, “I couldn’t Bernie it,” she said, referring to the Vermont senator who inspired a meme by attending the inauguration in woolly mittens—great for cozily witnessing history, lousy for typing.<br />To cope, Ms. Cooney did what countless others have this winter: She bought a space heater. But she wasn’t willing to settle for one of the infernal cages Grannies have been known to wheel out to save a few dollars on the gas bill. “I didn’t want an eyesore,” she said, or, for that matter, a fire hazard in her wood-beamed home.<br />After a thorough hunt, she splurged on a handsome Dyson Pure Hot+Cool HP04 ($650, dyson.com), which can heat or cool up to 800 square feet, and features a built-in air purifier as well as the ability to monitor air quality on the unit’s screen. (The activated carbon and glass HEPA filter on the slightly newer Dyson HP06, $750, can also capture and destroy formaldehyde in the air.) “I wanted something that would work for me year round,” Ms. Cooney said.<br />The Dyson is among a new class of stylish yet powerful, remote-controlled, or even app-enabled heaters that let you adjust the temperature without having to slink off-screen during a Zoom call.

      <td>The big challenge for the next boss of  Ferrari  will be managing the racing-car brand’s strategy for cutting tailpipe emissions.<br />The pandemic halted the car manufacturer’s production lines for seven weeks—with a 10% knock-on reduction in sales last year, the company reported Tuesday. Otherwise, Ferrari has cruised through the crisis with few scratches. It projects a rebound in revenue this year to roughly 13% more than its pre-pandemic 2019 total, underpinned by strong orders since last summer. The shares fell 5% in morning trading, perhaps because some investors were hoping for an even stronger outlook from a company that has routinely beat expectations in recent years.<br />Since its 2015 initial public offering, investors have gradually come to treat Ferrari as an exception to the general rule that car makers are capital-intensive, low-margin businesses whose shares are better suited to hedge-fund trades than long-term money. Given its small production volumes and big backlog of orders from ultrarich clients, they see the Italian company as a luxury-goods maker, not a metal basher.<br />But in one respect Ferrari is like other car makers: It needs to reinvent its powertrains. Environmental rules are tightening everywhere, punishing supercars, which produce disproportionate carbon emissions per mile. Consumer attitudes also are greener among younger generations that Ferrari needs to cultivate as future clients.<br />Former Chief Executive Louis Camilleri, who stepped down unexpectedly in December following a bad case of Covid-19, didn’t dodge the problem, investing in hybrid technology and decarbonizing production. The company delivered its first hybrid model, the SF90 Stradale, in the fourth quarter.</td>

They are also relying on evidence returned from the more than 500 grand jury subpoenas and search warrants they have obtained to date.<br />One alleged rioter, Ryan Samsel, was accused in a complaint unsealed Saturday of pushing barricades against a police line, knocking down one officer who hit her head on a flight of stairs behind her and lost consciousness.

      <td>Skyworks, Cirrus Logic show benefits and risks of Apple dependency</td>
      <td>Apple Inc.  is definitely having a moment. For the many chip companies who supply the tech giant, the question remains just how long that moment will last.<br />Last week, Apple reported its best quarter in years. It enjoyed strength across its business segments, but the key driver was the iPhone—which still accounts for more than half the company’s total revenue. iPhone revenue jumped 17% year over year to a record $65.6 billion for the December quarter, thanks mainly to the launch of the new iPhone 12 models in the fall. Apple no longer discloses unit sales, but market research firms IDC, Canalys and Counterpoint estimate the company shipped between 82 million and 90 million iPhones during the quarter, which would also break the record 78.3 million units the company reported for the same quarter of 2016.<br />That is great news for the companies who supply key iPhone components. Skyworks, which specializes in radio-frequency chips, last week reported a 69% year-over-year jump in December-quarter revenue to $1.5 billion—42% above Wall Street’s expectations. The stock has climbed 15% since that report.  Cirrus Logic ,  whose chips are used for audio encoding, reported Monday that its December-quarter revenue rose 30% from a year earlier to about $486 million.<br />More are on the way.  Qorvo ,  a Skyworks competitor, is expected to post a 23% increase in revenue for the December quarter on Wednesday, according to consensus analyst forecasts. Also coming Wednesday is December-quarter results from  Qualcomm ,  which recently won back its place in the iPhone’s modem chip socket. Analysts expect Qualcomm to post an 80% year-over-year quarterly rise in chipset revenue, according to FactSet.<br />But dependency on Apple can backfire. Over the long term, suppliers face the risk that Apple could design them out with its own in-house chips. Over the short term, seasonal fluctuations can also hurt. Cirrus projected March-quarter revenue in a range of $280 million to $320 million—the midpoint of which was only in line with Wall Street’s estimates. That would represent 7% growth year over year, a significant slowdown from the previous quarter. The company warned in its letter to shareholders that “our customers can, and frequently do, change individual orders on short notice.” Apple accounted for 84% of Cirrus’ revenue for the past three quarters, according to the company’s quarterly filing Monday. Cirrus shares were down 5% Tuesday morning.</td>

Chief Executive Arne Sorenson will reduce his schedule over the next few months to allow for a more demanding treatment for pancreatic cancer, leaving day-to-day operations to lieutenants, the company said.<br />The hotel chain in 2019 disclosed that Mr. Sorenson, 62 years old, had been diagnosed with the illness and was starting treatment. Mr. Sorenson, who remains president, CEO and a board member, will be “directing the company to the extent practical,” Marriott said Tuesday.<br />Stephanie Linnartz, the group president for consumer operations, technology and emerging businesses, will oversee Marriott’s international lodging division, as well as legal, human resources, communications and public affairs, the Bethesda, Md.-based company said. Tony Capuano, the group president for global development, design and operations services, will be in charge of the company’s U.S. and Canada lodging division and finance, it added. Both executives are assuming additional responsibilities on top of their current jobs.<br />“While I have worked throughout my treatment to date and plan to remain as engaged in the business as my health allows, the right thing to do for me, my family and the company is to focus on my health,” Mr. Sorenson said. He said his treatment is being handled at Johns Hopkins.<br />Mr. Sorenson led the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide in September 2016, creating a hotel giant with a presence in 130 countries and territories. The company has 30 hotel brands, including Sheraton, Ritz-Carlton, Westin, Le Méridien, Courtyard and Aloft.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Donald Trump and House impeachment managers will give the Senate details of their respective strategies Tuesday ahead of the trial on a charge that the former president incited a riot at the U.S. Capitol, with Mr. Trump’s team planning to argue that the entire exercise is unconstitutional.<br />Mr. Trump had until noon to respond to a summons, while the House Democrats prosecuting the case had until 10 a.m. to submit a trial brief. Under the rough rules sketched out for the trial, the parties are charged with answering two main questions: whether Mr. Trump can be tried in the Senate for acts committed when he was president, and how they respond to the charge of “incitement of insurrection.”<br />Forty-five of the Senate’s 50 Republicans last week sided on a procedural vote with the argument that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional because Mr. Trump is now a private citizen, and Mr. Trump’s legal team plans to emphasize that point. The key premise of Tuesday’s filing will be the argument that convicting Mr. Trump would be unconstitutional, adviser Jason Miller said. The defense team also plans to argue that the impeachment proceedings were conducted inappropriately, pointing to the fact that Democrats introduced no witnesses or evidence and didn’t allow Mr. Trump to have a lawyer present.<br />“He’s basically being impeached based on speeches made by politicians in Congress,” Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, said in an interview. Mr. Giuliani isn’t serving on the former president’s defense team.<br />House Democrats have been busy honing arguments that the trial is constitutional. “The whole argument defies common sense,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the lead impeachment manager, said in an interview last month. “It seems to say that if a president decides to commit the most atrocious act of trying to foment a violent insurrection or stage a coup against the country, but does it in the last couple weeks in office, that president cannot be impeached and tried in the Senate for doing it.”</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Russia’s homegrown Sputnik V vaccine showed high levels of efficacy and safety in a peer-reviewed study released Tuesday, a potential boost for the Kremlin’s aim to promote the Covid-19 shot abroad and curb the pandemic at home.<br />The findings, from a preliminary analysis of a large-scale clinical trial published in the British medical journal the Lancet, demonstrated that the two-shot vaccine was 91.6% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 and offered complete protection against severe cases. There were no serious side effects, the paper said. The vaccine was also found to be similarly safe and effective in elderly people.<br />The study could be a significant milestone for Moscow in the global vaccination race, potentially offering President Vladimir Putin’s government geopolitical clout in the developing world and the chance to tap into the lucrative global vaccine market. Russia—the world’s fourth worst-hit country with nearly four million cases—has also banked on Sputnik V to avoid new costly lockdowns as authorities plan to vaccinate 60% of the domestic population by the end of the year.<br />The shot, which was approved by Russian authorities in August before undergoing large-scale clinical trials, has stirred questions in light of its fast-tracked development and lack of published trial data. So far, Sputnik V has been administered to more than two million people world-wide, including in Argentina, Serbia and Algeria, according to Russian authorities.<br />Tuesday’s results could help clear doubts surrounding the Russian shot.</td>

      <td>For oil  supermajor BP ,  one big obstacle stands out on the road to a greener future: its almost 20% stake in Russia’s top oil producer.<br />On Tuesday, the British company reported disappointing 2020 results, hit by lower prices, depressed demand and asset write-offs. The shares fell in early trading, having significantly underperformed peers since Chief Executive Bernard Looney announced a new strategy in September. The plan to move away from fossil fuels and into clean energy and convenience retailing has been sufficient to scare off some traditional investors, but not radical enough to attract green-minded ones.<br />The investment in Rosneft is a problem. The Russian state-backed company has a plan to develop the fragile Arctic region with 6,500 wells and 5,500 km of pipelines, as well as airports, ports, towns and highways, all working to produce and distribute 1 million tons of oil a year. The so-called Vostok project is kryptonite for the environmental investors BP is hoping to attract.<br />The company wants to sell $25 billion in assets by 2025 to pay down debt, but not the Rosneft stake. That is despite BP’s lack of control: It has two board seats and some influence, but Moscow is definitely in charge.<br />Mr. Looney said Tuesday that the Rosneft stake fits well with the new strategy. The Russian company’s production costs are about half of BP’s, and it plans to decrease its greenhouse-gas intensity. The stake is a “good financial investment,” he said, having contributed $4 billion in dividends to BP since 2013.</td>

Facebook first removed the Myawaddy television network from its platform in 2018 as part of a crackdown on hundreds of pages, groups and accounts—some tied to Myanmar’s military—that it said had abused its services, but a page promoting the station later reappeared.<br />After The Wall Street Journal asked Monday why the Myawaddy page was operational given its earlier ban, Facebook removed it and it now displays a message saying “This Page Isn’t Available.”<br />A spokesman for the military didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the page’s removal. A separate Facebook page for announcements from the military wasn’t banned in 2018 and remains operational.<br />The head of Myanmar’s military, Gen.

That compares with a 3.5% decline for the U.S. economy last year, supported by a strong rebound in the fourth quarter. China’s economy grew by around 2.3% last year.<br />Since the start of the pandemic, European policy makers have sought to balance saving lives and supporting businesses, but have generally pursued more draconian restrictions to stop the virus’s spread than has the U.S. Nonetheless, the death toll in Europe is approaching that of U.S., while its economic performance—already lagging behind the U.S. before the pandemic—has been much worse than other advanced economies.<br />Now, a sluggish rollout of vaccines, the threat of highly contagious new variants of the virus and the possibility of weeks or months of continued restrictions bode ill for the near term and could delay a recovery. EU countries have administered vaccines to less than 3% of their populations compared with 9% in the U.S. and 14% in the U.K., according to OurWorldInData.</td>

That generated 498.2 billion yuan, equivalent to $74.1 billion, in gross merchandise value during those 11 days, excluding unpaid orders, up 26% from the same time frame in 2019, the company said Tuesday.<br />Sales for the fiscal third quarter rose about 37% to 221.08 billion yuan, ahead of the 214.29 billion yuan analysts polled by FactSet had expected.<br />The company’s cloud-computing revenue grew 50% to 16.12 billion yuan, a gain the company attributed to customers in the internet, retail and public sectors. Alibaba said it processed 583,000 orders per second during the 11.11 event.<br />The company’s results come after the suspension of a blockbuster initial public offering of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group Co. in November, a sudden halt to what would have been the world’s largest IPO. The move delivered an extraordinary rebuke to Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder of both Alibaba and Ant who drew the ire of Chinese regulators when he gave a speech at a financial forum in Shanghai in October. Chinese authorities have launched a probe into Alibaba for alleged anticompetitive behavior on its e-commerce platform.</td>

Meanwhile, producers around the world are boosting prices for the wood mash at unusually sharp rates.  Domtar Corp. , based in South Carolina, said it would raise prices this month between $100 and $130 a ton, depending on grade.<br />“Spot prices are really jumping,” said Brian McClay, a pulp-market consultant and a founder of pricing service Trade Tree Online. “I’ve been in the pulp business since 1978 and have been asking friends: No one has seen this before, no one has seen the scale of this.”<br />Prices are hottest for softwood pulp, the type that comes from coniferous trees and is used to make products such as premium toilet tissue, paper towels, junk mail and coffee cups. It is made from sawmill scraps as well as from trees too skinny, knotty or crooked to be cut into lumber.<br />China buys more than one-third of the world’s pulp and churns out paper products and packaging. Shanghai pulp futures, which began trading in 2018, serve as a price guide for an array of varieties and grades, similar to the way that West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude futures are reference points for oil prices.</td>

The agency said the problem affected roughly 158,000 vehicles, including Model S sedans built between 2012 and early 2018 and Model X vehicles made from 2016 through early 2018.<br />The reason for the discrepancy between the NHTSA’s figure and the number of vehicles Tesla plans to recall wasn’t immediately clear.<br />Tesla said in a letter to federal regulators made public Tuesday that while it disagreed that the issue constituted a defect in the vehicles, it was going ahead with a recall to conclude the investigation and provide a better experience for customers.<br />“It is economically, if not technologically, infeasible to expect that such components can or should be designed to last the vehicle’s entire useful life,” Tesla said in the letter.</td>

      <td>Amazon . com Inc.’s plans for its new northern Virginia headquarters feature an outdoor theme, the latest sign that big tech companies are getting more creative with office space rather than abandoning it.<br />Phase two of the company’s development in Arlington, Va., calls for  three 22-story office buildings and smaller retail buildings surrounded by woodlands, an outdoor amphitheater, a dog run and parking for around 950 bicycles.<br />The centerpiece will be the site’s fourth and tallest tower, a 350-foot structure dubbed the Helix because it will feature two spiraling outdoor walkways with trees and plants from Virginia that twist to the building’s top.<br />Amazon, which is unveiling the designs on Tuesday, said the cluster of new office and retail buildings will accommodate around 13,000 employees, with room for more. The project is part of Amazon’s more than $2.5 billion, 25,000-employee office campus, which the Seattle-based company calls its second headquarters.<br />While numerous tech firms have pledged to allow employees to work from home even after the coronavirus pandemic is contained, Amazon,  Facebook Inc.,   Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and others have continued to expand their urban office footprints. By investing heavily in big city real estate, they are betting that office space will be an important part of their corporate culture after the pandemic is over.</td>

Shares have zoomed from $4 all the way to above $400, and John Broderick’s Permit Capital and Kurt Wolf’s Hestia Capital have each made probably more than $100 million, at least in paper gains, according to regulatory filings. The duo risked their reputations on the future of GameStop and in doing so helped plant the seeds that turned into a stock rally that has captivated Wall Street.<br />“It’s sort of like after the Super Bowl when they ask someone how it feels and they say it doesn’t feel real,” said Mr. Broderick. “I guess I can go to Disney World.”<br />Their realized profits aren’t quite equal to each other’s right now, their stock-picking fairy tale colliding with the reality of corporate bylaws.</td>

Russian authorities say Mr. Navalny repeatedly violated the terms of his parole, including when he was recuperating in Germany after he was poisoned.<br />Prosecutors made their request when Mr. Navalny was abroad. The opposition leader says it was meant to deter him from returning to Russia, where he had promised to resume his campaign against President Vladimir Putin.<br />Alexei Navalny is Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, a fierce anticorruption activist who has managed to galvanize Russia’s political opposition by exposing flaws in the more than 20-year rule of Mr. Putin.<br />Mr. Navalny first dove into politics as part of a broader ethnic Russian nationalist movement. But in 2012, he pivoted to become part of a wider coalition of opposition groups that sought to lead protests against Mr. Putin’s decision to return as president after serving for four years as prime minister.<br />Mr. Navalny is a skilled speaker who rouses crowds with ease, but his real weapon is his YouTube channel that gives him a nationwide platform to reach nearly 4 million subscribers and urge them to protest in the streets of Moscow and other big cities.</td>

      <td>India’s aggressive new fiscal plan will be a boon to its post-Covid recovery. But there is still no coherent longer-term plan for lifting the country into the upper-middle-income club.<br />First, the good news. The finance ministry has opted to generously lubricate the stuttering economy, setting a deficit target for the coming financial year significantly higher than expected, at 6.8% of gross domestic product. That means a plan to cut the deficit to 3% of GDP within five years has been effectively abandoned.<br />The expanded deficit isn’t just down to lower tax revenue, but higher spending on infrastructure, health and education. India suffered one of the world’s sharpest downturns during the pandemic, with second-quarter GDP down 23% from a year earlier. For now, the benefits of a supportive fiscal policy far outweigh the drawbacks.<br />What is less promising is what the budget suggests about the government’s overall strategy to lift incomes over the longer term, especially in the context of other recent policy decisions.<br />India now sits conspicuously outside both large Asian trade blocs: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the more recent Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. It is not the obvious choice for any manufacturer looking to expand operations outside of East Asia but within a unified supply chain.</td>

SPAC stands for special-purpose acquisition company, a vehicle for swiftly taking entities public.<br />Alameda-based Astra, which has about 120 employees, late last year blasted a rocket to the edge of space from a launchpad in Kodiak, Alaska. The booster failed to reach orbit velocity during that demonstration flight in December. Company founder and Chief Executive Chris Kemp, a former high-ranking NASA official, said he expects another test soon, followed by an initial commercial mission as early as summer.<br />In going public, Astra seeks to stand out from a bevy of small-rocket competitors by locking in funding despite fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and an anticipated shakeout of rivals targeting the same market segment.<br />The company says it is able to lift satellites weighing about 100 pounds into low-earth orbit, but gradually hopes to increase that capacity about fivefold. Astra’s move comes amid a boom in the use of relatively compact satellites for internet access, earth imaging, military applications and other purposes.</td>

      <td>LONDON— BP  PLC returned to profit in the fourth quarter but said the pandemic, which battered the oil-and-gas industry in 2020, would continue to challenge its business this year.<br />Covid-19 has sapped demand for oil, hitting prices, and prompted the world’s biggest energy companies to slash spending, cut jobs, write down the value of their assets and—in the case of BP and  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC—lower dividends. The crisis led U.S. oil giants  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp.  to discuss a merger, according to people familiar with the matter, although the talks didn’t progress.<br />BP said Tuesday its earnings had suffered from weaker gas marketing and trading results, while refining margins and utilization remained under pressure. However, this was partly offset by income from asset sales, including some proceeds from the $5 billion sale of its petrochemicals business to Ineos Ltd.<br />The company reported a replacement cost profit—a metric similar to the net income figure that U.S. oil companies report—of $825 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, from a loss of $4 million in the year-earlier period. For the full year, it reported a loss of $18.1 billion, from a profit of $3.5 billion in 2019.<br />BP said Covid-19 restrictions would continue to sap demand early in 2021 and that the pandemic may have an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period.</td>

Robinhood and other brokers were deluged by traders looking to invest in GameStop and other shares, often with options contracts that can increase leverage and trading risk. A clearinghouse that processes and settles trades watched the volatile trading and demanded more collateral to cope with potential losses.<br />Robinhood Chief Executive Vlad Tenev explained the demand Sunday night in an interview on a livestream on Clubhouse, a social-networking app. “The request was around $3 billion, which is, you know, about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is,” Mr. Tenev said.<br />A margin call is not a conspiracy. A clearinghouse is an intermediary between buyers and sellers in a financial market. It “clears,” or finalizes, trades and makes sure the parties fulfill the contract and assets are delivered. It also mitigates risk by requiring that trades be backed by enough capital to reduce the chances that one of the trading parties goes bankrupt. This protects investors as well as brokers.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Investigators have made a preliminary determination that the police officer who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt during the U.S. Capitol riot shouldn’t be charged with any crimes in connection with her death, according to people familiar with the review.<br />Ms. Babbitt, who served for more than a dozen years in the Air Force and Air National Guard and became a passionate supporter of former President Donald Trump, died from being shot by a Capitol Police officer after rioters smashed through a door to the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6. She had entered the building as part of a crowd aiming to disrupt the certification of President Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.<br />The officer who shot her had been placed on leave soon after the riot while Ms. Babbitt’s death was being investigated, including on the question of whether it was a violation of her civil rights.<br />The Justice Department said in announcing the investigation that it was following routine procedure for whenever a police officer uses deadly force by having the Washington Metropolitan Police Department examine the shooting. The police investigators have made an initial determination that charges against the officer aren’t warranted, the people said, adding that Justice Department officials haven’t yet made a final determination on the matter. The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington is leading the broader investigation into the riot and prosecuting the more than 150 cases that have resulted to date.<br />A Justice Department spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Any final charging decision would likely have to be approved by senior Justice Department leadership, who haven’t yet been briefed on the matter.</td>

      <td>The U.S. response needs to take into account China’s regional designs.</td>
      <td>From protests in Moscow to Chinese air incursions over Taiwan, the world is wasting no time testing Joe Biden’s foreign policy team of liberal internationalists. On Monday Americans woke up to news of a swift and (so far) bloodless coup in Burma, whose transition to democratic government was touted by the Obama Administration as one of its major achievements.<br />Now the country’s generals are moving to reassert control after their party was walloped in November elections. Aung San Suu Kyi, the top elected leader of Burma (also called Myanmar), wanted to use her mandate to change the constitution to limit the generals’ power. That looks like the trigger for the military’s forced suspension of civilian government and communications blackout.<br />The Biden Administration is rightly denouncing the move, but the U.S. has limited leverage acting alone. The West has used market access as a carrot to urge Burma’s military rulers to cede power to Ms. Suu Kyi. Yet the extent that a power transition actually occurred was exaggerated. A return to economically isolating the country of 54 million on China’s southern border could hurt the Burmese people and play into Beijing’s hands.<br />As our Walter Russell Meadwrote in 2019, “Western fecklessness has made China look to Myanmar like a more stable and reliable partner.” President Trump’s great-power diplomacy was sometimes crudely transactional. Yet the Biden team might be tempted to pivot too far in the opposite direction, stressing liberal values at the expense of core American interests.<br />The top U.S. priority in Asia is limiting Beijing’s ability to control independent states like Burma, which is strategically situated in the Indo-Pacific. China is holding back from condemning the coup, likely in hopes of making diplomatic inroads with a military government.</td>

      <td>He criticizes Putin on Navalny but offers a gift on nuclear arms control.</td>
      <td>Donald Trump went easy on Russia and Vladimir Putin rhetorically while supporting tougher policies than his predecessor. Now President Biden is taking the opposite approach. At least that’s the early message from the Administration’s first decision on arms control and its response to Russia’s growing domestic protests.<br />On Sunday Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he is “deeply disturbed by the violent crackdown” on Russian protesters and the arrests of thousands demanding the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Mr. Blinken said Russians are fed up with “corruption” and “autocracy” and added that Mr. Biden delivered a similar message in a phone call with Mr. Putin.<br />Good to hear, but the Administration sent a very different signal by embracing an unconditional five-year extension of the New Start nuclear arms treaty, which Mr. Putin made formal on Friday. The accord is a classic 20th century arms-control treaty that was inadequate when it came into force a decade ago.<br />New Start limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and bombs at 1,550. It also caps the deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles and nuclear-equipped heavy bombers. The deal would have expired Feb. 5, but Mr. Biden took the longest extension possible.<br />This squanders useful diplomatic work by the Trump Administration. While Washington withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) and Open Skies treaties, which Russia was violating, it tried to negotiate a shorter extension to New Start last year.</td>

      <td>Europe wants to lure Yellen into a revenue raid on U.S. tech giants.</td>
      <td>Most world leaders hope the new Biden Administration augurs a more, how shall we say, “cooperative spirit” when it comes to allies. An early test, concerning tax policy, highlights how disappointed some may be.<br />The Biden team takes power as other governments are launching a push to grab more revenue from American tech companies. Fiscal jealousy has been rife for years as large U.S. companies such as Google,  Facebook  and  Apple  earned billions of dollars in high-tax-rate jurisdictions while existing tax rules allowed them to book the profits and pay tax in lower-rate countries.<br />This phenomenon provoked varied responses. The stick is an array of digital services taxes imposed by France, Spain and the U.K. targeting revenue—not profits—of the U.S. tech companies. The carrot is a negotiation led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development supposedly to provide tech companies legal certainty by revamping the rules governing taxation of global companies.<br />The Trump Administration cooled on that effort and threatened tariffs against governments imposing discriminatory taxes on U.S. tech firms. Foreign officials hope President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be more amenable, and Ms. Yellen’s confirmation hearing was marked by promises to work with the OECD.<br />Look closer, however, and problems appear. One proposal would upend decades-old global rules that tax a company where it is headquartered rather than where it does business. The OECD and some governments want to base taxation on where revenue is earned. The OECD also wants a global minimum tax. Each country would commit to taxing at least 12.5% of the profits of companies headquartered there—primarily to make sure the company isn’t paying “too little” via legal planning.</td>

      <td>The successful vaccine program followed the model of U.S. mobilization in World War II.</td>
      <td>Every day new questions and criticisms arise about Operation Warp Speed, the public-private vaccine development initiative launched by presidential order in May 2020. Most of that criticism focuses on the distribution bottlenecks that have developed in different states, as Americans are impatient with the slow pace of the rollout. Jen Psaki, President Biden’s press secretary, has claimed to see an “urgent need to address failures of the Trump team approach to vaccine distribution.” Some in the new administration even want to rename the program.<br />Nearly all these claims rest on a misunderstanding both of Operation Warp Speed’s mission and its nature as a government program. While President Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and others dubbed the original project MP2, or Manhattan Project 2, after the crash effort to build an atomic bomb, Operation Warp Speed’s leadership borrowed a more practical model: the industrial mobilization during World War II that produced the so-called Arsenal of Democracy.<br />That model can still push the vaccine rollout over the finish line. Governors and other state officials in particular need to realize the federal government is operating in the wake of a health-care version of Pearl Harbor, and adjust their operations accordingly.<br />From the beginning the principal mission of Operation Warp Speed was the development, manufacturing, and distribution—i.e., shipping—of coronavirus vaccines. To date, the program has managed to produce and deliver about 50 million vaccine doses—all made in the U.S.—with hundreds of millions more on the way. It also had 97,000 certified receivers distributing the vaccine across the U.S.<br />It is the most remarkable achievement in modern medicine, made possible by following the model of the World War II mobilization effort. That model rests on three principles.</td>

      <td>His ‘Buy American’ plan is worse than Trump’s for suppliers.</td>
      <td>President Biden doubled down on Donald Trump’s “Buy American” campaign, signing a Jan. 25 executive order that would not only maintain Mr. Trump’s destructive protectionism, but increase the burdens on international trade.<br />Mr. Biden’s new order will keep Mr. Trump’s mandate that the federal government buy goods made domestically. But it adds a new, highly disruptive mandate to raise the threshold for foreign components going into those finished goods, along with the establishment of a panel to reduce the many exemptions the Trump administration had made.<br />Despite its antitrade image, the Trump administration hadn’t even finalized its own “Buy American” rules until two days before leaving office, suggesting a gap between rhetoric and economic reality that the new administration seeks to close.<br />In the wake of Mr. Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, this was a second body blow to Canadian workers. This is because components are key to Canada’s exports to the U.S., which make up around 80% of all of Canada’s exports. Considering that Canada’s two largest exports are natural resources and automotive components, together accounting for nearly two-thirds of Canada’s total exports, the new president seems to be going for his neighbor’s jugular.<br />North American supply chains integrate industries on both sides of the border, especially in the automotive sector. U.S. scrap steel, for instance, is exported to Ontario, where U.S. manufacturers such as Ford and  General Motors  use it to produce vehicles for export back to the U.S. Mandates on where components are made risk shutting countries out of existing supply chains.</td>

      <td>Team Biden will be disappointed if it mistakes them for starry-eyed idealists.</td>
      <td>Sooner or later every new presidential administration experiences that sinking feeling that one of its big ideas may not be working well. For Team Biden, that moment arrived last week as Germany, with widespread support in the European Union, made clear that Europe has no real interest in countering either Russia or China.<br />Warning against the “building of blocs,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told her virtual audience at the World Economic Forum that she thought Europe should not join with either the U.S. or China against the other. Coming on top of an earlier European refusal to defer moving on an EU-China investment accord until the incoming Biden administration could weigh in on the matter, Europe has made its views crystal clear. Uighurs, Hong Kong and the growing military threats in and around the South China Sea matter much less to European policy makers than their commercial interests do.<br />Alexei Navalny’s challenge to President Vladimir Putin has likewise prompted a European response that is less than robust. As democracy activists and human-rights organizations on both sides of the Atlantic sought to pressure Western governments to do something about Mr. Navalny’s detention and the arrests across Russia, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs announced that he was pressing ahead with a previously planned visit to Moscow for meetings with Mr. Putin. Light wrist slaps may follow, but little more.<br />For starry-eyed American liberals—in whose rich fantasies Europe’s chancelleries are inhabited by committed idealists—this may come as a shock. Europeans aren’t from Mars, and some may hail from Venus, as Robert Kagan put it in his 2004 essay “Of Paradise and Power.” But those who rule the Continent come mostly from Pluto, a cold and remote planet named for the ancient god of the underworld—and of wealth.<br />It’s a mistake to see Europeans as idealists merely because they like multilateralism and discount the importance of military power. Multilateralism is a realist program for Europe, not an idealist one. Even the largest European states know that they are too small to figure as great powers on their own; they must work together if they want to sway Washington and Beijing. As Mr. Kagan noted, they also understand that a rules-based international order grounded in multilateral institutions increases European world influence.</td>
