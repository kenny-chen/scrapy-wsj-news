      <td>Retailer’s shares were up more than 57% on Wednesday</td>
      <td>Investors who bet that shares of  GameStop Corp.  would fall shifted positions Wednesday, sending the struggling videogame retailer’s stock soaring to its highest levels in years.<br />GameStop shares were up more than 57% to $31.40 on Wednesday, marking a steep climb from a year earlier, when the stock was valued at just $4.61 a share.<br />That recovery—fueled in part by the company’s announcement two days ago that it would add Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen and two of his former colleagues to its board—created a so-called short squeeze that drove share prices sharply higher, according to some analysts. A short squeeze occurs when traders respond to an increase in price for a stock they bet would drop by purchasing shares in order to avoid losses.<br />Many traders believed GameStop’s shares were set to decline. As of the end of last year, short interest in the stock—expressed as a percentage of GameStop shares available for trading—exceeded 138%, making it the second-most shorted company by that metric with a market value of at least $1 billion, according to data from FactSet.<br />It is fairly rare that short interest would exceed shares available to trade on the public markets, said James Angel, a Georgetown University professor who studies financial markets. Such positions can build up because traders are able to borrow shares from other investors, and those shares can be loaned more than once, according to Dr. Angel.</td>

      <td>The Latin name for a marauding ancient Germanic tribe made its way into the new article of impeachment against Donald Trump</td>
      <td>The article of impeachment introduced against President Trump accuses him of inciting a crowd that “unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol,” among other “violent, deadly, destructive and seditious acts.” As the Journal has reported, the pro-Trump rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 vandalized statues and other historic artwork housed there.<br />Even before last week’s riot, politically motivated vandalism was in the news. When Congress adjourned its 2020 session without passing a bill approving $2,000 stimulus checks, the homes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were both vandalized with spray paint.<br />“Vandalize” and “vandalism” are formed from “vandal,” for someone who willfully or maliciously damages property. The words memorialize historic acts of destruction from a millennium and a half ago that went far beyond defacing statues or spray-painting graffiti.<br />The original vandals were a Germanic people who sacked Rome in 455 AD, after overrunning Gaul, Spain and northern Africa. The Latin name for the tribe was the “Vandali,” plural of “Vandalus.” That was simply the Roman version of the name used by tribal members themselves in an early Germanic language. Etymologists think the name may go back to a Proto-Germanic root, “wandljaz,” meaning “wanderer.”<br />Because the Vandals were associated with plundering Roman civilization, the word was transferred to someone who disregards or damages items of historical or cultural significance, or someone who acts in a barbaric fashion.</td>

The shares closed at $97.24.<br />The enthusiastic reception for Affirm shares could indicate that 2021 will be similar to 2020. That was the most lucrative year on record for public offerings in terms of money raised, driven in part by the success of companies like  DoorDash Inc.  that have benefited during the pandemic from the stay-at-home economy.<br />Still, extreme first-day pops in the share prices of  Airbnb Inc.  and other tech companies prompted some companies to delay their IPOs late last year for fear of missing out on billions of additional dollars. After shelving plans for an IPO in December, videogame company Roblox Corp. said last week that it raised $520 million on the private market and is planning a direct listing of its shares.<br />Affirm Chief Executive Max Levchin said that focusing on where its shares would trade on the first day is “another fine example of getting caught up in the frenzy for all the wrong reasons.”</td>

Mr. Gelsinger, who was once Intel’s technology chief, has served as CEO of the business-software provider since 2012.<br />The leadership transition unfolds after Intel last year ceded the title as America’s most valuable semiconductor company to rival  Nvidia Corp.  and fell further behind rivals in churning out the most advanced chips. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is also considering a broader embrace of third-party chip makers rather than relying on its own factories.<br />“This is incredibly important strategically to what Intel is looking to accomplish and be defined more as a technology innovator and operator,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, a wealth-management firm that owns a stake in Intel through one of its funds.<br />Mr. Swan joined Intel in 2016 as chief financial officer. He was named interim CEO two years later and formally given the top job in January 2019.</td>

And until recent years, lower courts had uniformly ruled that the FTC had the power to do so.<br />But many of the same justices also suggested the text of the relevant 1973 law, which gives the FTC the right to seek court injunctions against nefarious activity, doesn’t explicitly give it the right to seek financial judgments as well.<br />“If it is a mistake, it has been around for 50 years,” said Justice Stephen Breyer, adding that courts sometimes have to let “bygones be bygones.”<br />But Justice Breyer also said the FTC in recent years had been seeking to recover money in cases that weren’t necessarily egregious, which raised concerns about fairness to the business community.</td>

      <td>Chip maker’s manufacturing slip will take years to repair in a fast-moving market</td>
      <td>Intel Corp.  has returned to form with its new boss. But in many other ways, there may be no going back for the storied chip maker.<br />Intel announced Wednesday that Pat Gelsinger will take over the chief executive’s reins from Bob Swan, who’s effectively held the position for just two and a half years. That’s the shortest run of any Intel chief—about half the time of his immediate predecessor who was booted from the company following the discovery of an affair with a subordinate. Mr. Swan’s tenure was marked less by scandal and more by the other major problem he inherited—the loss of Intel’s position as the world’s most advanced chip manufacturer.<br />As an engineer with a 30-year stint at Intel under his belt, Mr. Gelsinger might seem more suited to addressing this problem. And his most recent job running VMware has made him a highly regarded leader in Silicon Valley. Intel’s share price jumped 7% Wednesday on the news, while VMware’s stock slipped by the same amount.<br />But Mr. Gelsinger is inheriting problems that have no quick fix. Intel’s struggles with advancing its chip-making process began before Mr. Swan came on board—and they have deepened since. The company disclosed in July that its latest process for manufacturing chips at 7 nanometers ran into new problems that would delay mass production on that process to late 2022. Rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, is already making more advanced chips at 5 nanometers.<br />Being two generations behind a fast-moving rival has forced Intel to consider the rather unorthodox option of outsourcing the production of some of its most advanced chips to TSMC. That could help Intel close the manufacturing gap that has let  Advanced Micro Devices —another TSMC customer—pick up share in the PC and data center markets. But it would be a significant shift for a company that has long based its competitive advantage on being an integrated manufacturer.</td>

The moves came after Mr. Floyd, a Black man, was killed by police in May, inciting a national debate about systemic racism.<br />At the time, the companies said the money they pledged would go toward boosting the net worth of Black families, creating professional opportunities for minorities and diversifying their own ranks, among other outcomes.</td>

The new ban could have a significant impact especially in the apparel sector, which has already faced a number of customs restrictions amid concern about forced labor linked to the camps.<br />Beijing has denied such allegations and calls the camps vocational training centers. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington called the forced-labor allegations groundless and criticized Wednesday’s order as an attempt by the U.S. to suppress Xinjiang enterprises.</td>

      <td>We’re done with avoiding it. Indeed, we’re saving it, rendering it and using it to make all kinds of dishes more delicious.</td>
      <td>THERE’S NO fat-shaming in butchery. What some might consider a scrap is actually a kitchen asset.<br />As the cooking credo goes: Fat equals flavor. Science even proves it. “There is a growing body of research that supports fat as a sixth primary taste,” said Nik Sharma, author of “The Flavor Equation: The Science of Great Cooking Explained.” Mr. Sharma ranks what scientists are calling oleogustus—fattiness/richness—right up there with the sweet, sour, salty, bitter and savory experiences that make eating pleasurable. “Fat makes food taste delicious,” he simply explained.<br />Meat-eaters can go beyond the bottles of oil and butters on hand in their kitchens by rendering out the flavorful fat from scraps they’ve trimmed away from cuts of meat. “It is really cost-effective. You get the most out of what you are paying for,” said Aaron Rocchino, butcher/proprietor of the Local Butcher Shop in Berkeley, Calif. Mr. Rocchino encourages saving fat from pork, beef and poultry. Once you amass enough, you can render it by cooking slowly until the fat melts and separates from the meaty matter it’s attached to, leaving a flavorful liquid medium for all kinds of cooking.<br />A chef as well as a butcher, Mr. Rocchino worked in such esteemed kitchens as Le Bernardin in New York and Chez Panisse in Berkeley, where he honed his whole-animal butchering skills. Over the years he forged relationships with livestock farmers that eventually propelled him to his own butcher shop. The Local Butcher Shop opened in 2011 with the mission of providing restaurant-quality meat to retail customers while using as much of the animal as possible—fat and all. Beyond prime meat cuts, the shop carries everything from stock to dog food to those delicious rendered fats.<br />Whether poultry schmaltz, pork lard or beef tallow, rendered fat can take a dish from good to glorious. “Choosing the right fat is key, as different fats have different flavors and different smoking points too,” Mr. Rocchino said. Rule of thumb: The smaller the animal, the milder the flavor; the larger the animal, the stronger the flavor. Chicken, duck and goose schmaltz add a gentle richness without overpowering. They also don’t have a high smoking point, so it’s best to use schmaltz for binding matzo balls, as an enhancement to a pot of rice or a medium for slow-roasting vegetables. (Potatoes roasted in duck or goose fat = bliss.)</td>

The earlier filing showed Mr. Karfunkel and his wife on July 29 donated a significantly larger sum—three million Kodak shares—to Congregation Chemdas Yisroel in Brooklyn, N.Y., a charity Mr. Karfunkel helped found. That donation left the couple with about 3.3 million shares, the filing said.<br />Mr. Karfunkel and officials of the charity didn’t respond to requests for comment. A Kodak spokesman said the company doesn’t comment on financial transactions of board members.<br />The original donation occurred at a turbulent time for Kodak’s stock. On July 29, Kodak’s stock sharply surged and closed at its highest level since 2014. The Rochester, N.Y., company and a federal agency had just announced the onetime photography giant was in line to receive a $765 million loan from the White House to help manufacture drugs for the fight against coronavirus.<br />U.S. International Development Finance Corp. subsequently put the loan on hold after the deal came under congressional and regulatory scrutiny.</td>

      <td>Central bank’s business contacts downgrade characterization of economic activity following surge in Covid-19 cases</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. economy grew “modestly” in the final weeks of 2020, as a resurgence in Covid-19 cases prompted activity in some sectors to slow, a Federal Reserve report said Wednesday.<br />The Fed’s periodic compilation of anecdotes from business contacts, known as the Beige Book, provided the latest evidence that the pandemic dealt a setback to the economic recovery in recent months. Soaring infection rates and efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 also contributed to the U.S. labor market’s loss of 140,000 jobs in December, the first employment decline since the pandemic struck last spring, the Labor Department said Friday.<br />“Although the prospect of Covid-19 vaccines has bolstered business optimism for 2021 growth, this has been tempered by concern over the recent virus resurgence and the implications for near-term business conditions,” the central bank said Wednesday. The report said most Fed districts reported that economic activity increased modestly since the previous reporting period, but noted “conditions remained varied.”<br />Two of the Fed’s 12 districts reported no growth in recent weeks, while two others reported declines in activity.<br />The Fed’s characterization of economic conditions represented a downgrade from its previous Beige Book report, released Dec. 2, when policy makers described economic growth as “modest or moderate.” At that time, business contacts signaled the possibility of a potential slowdown given the surge in Covid-19 infections that was under way.</td>

John McCain, the latest sign of infighting in the state party.<br />The resolutions, which if passed would express disapproval but have no formal consequences, come as the state GOP is distancing itself from many of the Republican Party’s longtime establishment figures. The three censure resolutions easily passed the party’s resolution committee and will be brought before the entire state committee on Jan. 23.<br />The proposed censures for each person refer to what some party members say is executive overreach by Mr. Ducey in his response to the pandemic, Mrs. McCain’s support for same-sex marriage, and Mrs. McCain’s and Mr. Flake’s endorsements of President-elect Joe Biden in the 2020 election, among other things.<br />In a statement, Mrs. McCain criticized Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward and denounced what she described as continuous insults and personal attacks. “She’s shown how attacking Republicans like me can impact elections—her involvement in both Senate elections to replace Jeff Flake and my husband John McCain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in Democrat wins,” Mrs. McCain said. “As Chairman of the AZGOP she managed to turn Arizona blue in November for the first time since 1996.”<br />Ms. Ward, who is up for re-election to her post next Saturday, hasn’t said how she will vote on the censure resolutions, but she has been critical of the party’s establishment wing in the past. She ran against Mr. McCain for the GOP Senate nomination in 2016.</td>

A survey released last month by the appliance company Bosch found that more than half of us consider ourselves “obsessed” with the stuff, consuming more than 400 pounds, on average, in drinks a year.<br />Camper English, a self-proclaimed “ice guru,” certainly qualifies as obsessed. The San Francisco cocktail writer and author of the popular “Alcademics” cocktail blog has helped fuel a movement with a single-minded, glistening agenda: ensuring that anyone can make cocktail-bar-quality ice at home.<br />As Mr. English discovered in over 15 elaborate tests over the span of 18 years, making big ice is easy. Making clear ice isn’t. He has tried—and debunked—popular internet ice-making theories on achieving the much-coveted clarity. He froze distilled water. He boiled and then reboiled water from the tap before pouring it into molds. “I tried ridiculous experiments, like using carbonated water,” said Mr. English. “Which didn’t have a good chance of being the solution.” (It wasn’t.)<br />Eventually, he read Mariana Gosnell’s 2007 book, “Ice: The Nature, the History, and the Uses of an Astonishing Substance,” and in 2009, realized he could replicate the way a pond froze from the top down using a small Igloo cooler stashed in his freezer. It worked, ultimately inspiring a variety of products that apply the top-down freezing principle, but on a smaller scale. While Mr. English himself never managed to commoditize his breakthrough, he continues to consult and speak on the topic.<br />Here, five ways to keep your cool—for those who love munching on ice and others like Mr. English who seek true translucency.</td>

      <td>Last month, Warner Bros. announced it is releasing 17 films on HBO Max this year and Disney+ promised dozens of Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar stories on the horizon. Then this week, Netflix unveiled a massive, star-studded film slate for 2021 that features some of the world’s biggest stars in roughly 70 titles, with at least one new movie promised every week.<br />The slate includes a western produced by Jay-Z (“The Harder They Fall”), a musical directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda (“tick, tick … BOOM”), and a comedy starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence (“Don’t Look Up”). There are also movies starring Idris Elba, Zendaya and John David Washington and Melissa McCarthy.<br />On Friday, Netflix releases the sci-fi/action flick, “Outside the Wire,” about a drone pilot and android officer working together to save the world. Release dates for most of the rest of Netflix’s 2021 titles are TBD.<br />Here’s what else is streaming this week:<br /></td>

The move followed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s monthly supply and demand report showing corn production falling short of expectations.<br />This week’s surge carried corn to its highest close since July 2013. Soybeans and wheat are also trading at their highest levels since 2014 this week, with soybeans above the $14 per bushel mark and wheat over $6.60 per bushel Wednesday.<br />“It’s an off-to-the-races kind of thing,” said Jason Britt, head of Central States Commodities in Kansas City, Mo.<br />Dry weather in key growing regions of the U.S. and South America has hit domestic corn production, which is expected to total 14.2 billion bushels for the current marketing year, 325 million bushels less than projected last month and 1.1 billion bushels below initial projections for the 2020 crop last summer, according to the USDA report.</td>

The CDC said preflight testing is necessary as Covid-19 cases continue to soar and new, more contagious strains of the virus emerge around the world.<br />Here is what you need to know about the new protocols before you take a trip.<br />The order applies to everyone traveling to the U.S. on international flights, including U.S. citizens. You will need to show negative test results even if you are flying on a private jet or charter flight. There are exceptions for children under age 2, airline crews, and federal law-enforcement agents and members of the military traveling for duty.<br />All of them. Passengers need to show proof of a negative test when traveling to the U.S. from any country, including Mexico and the Caribbean. Airlines can seek temporary waivers for certain countries where testing supplies are inadequate, but carriers haven’t yet said which countries might fall into this category.<br />The universal testing requirement goes into effect Jan. 26. People arriving from the U.K. already have been subject to similar testing requirements that went into effect in December following the emergence of a new coronavirus strain there.</td>

      <td>A show based on popular bodice-rippers gives an industry often dismissed as tawdry a much-needed embrace</td>
      <td>The new  Netflix  adaptation of the racy “Bridgerton” books has put pop culture in a swoon, giving a mainstream stamp of approval to romance novels sometimes dismissed as trash and boosting a literary genre that has suffered setbacks in recent years.<br />“Bridgerton,” which debuted last month, is based on bestselling author Julia Quinn’s romance series set in the Regency era. The love story about a wayward duke and a high-society bachelorette starring a multiracial cast is projected to stream to more than 63 million households over its first four weeks, according to Netflix. The lavish show, which hit number one on the Netflix charts in 76 countries, has vaulted Ms. Quinn’s roughly 20-year-old novels to the top of the general fiction bestseller lists.<br />“Hollywood studios are full of male producers, directors, writers,” said Amy Pierpont, editor in chief of Forever and Forever Yours, romance imprints of Grand Central Publishing. “The idea that the same value that’s applied to superhero movies would be applied to stories that center around women’s lives has just not happened on a consistent basis.”<br />The success of “Bridgerton” couldn’t have come at a better time for the romance industry, which has been struggling to retain its power in the publishing world. Recent years have marked a steady decline in print and ebook sales of romance novels, which went from more than 98 million units sold in 2012 to 41 million in 2020, according to NPD BookScan, whose figures do not reflect sales of self-published titles.<br />Novelists, publishing executives and literary agents point to a range of challenges. Big retail chains have stopped putting as many mass-market paperbacks on their shelves, they say, while the consolidation of printing plants has complicated distribution efforts. Others say less expensive digital self-publishing has cut into sales by traditional publishers.</td>

      <td>Iran has in recent months repeatedly violated the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reducing the time it would need to produce a nuclear weapon. The violations, a response to U.S. sanctions, have put at risk the survival of an agreement that helped remove sanctions on Iran and open it to business with the West.<br />The latest development emerged on Jan. 13 when the International Atomic Energy Agency told member states in a confidential report that Iran had told it in mid-December it planned to start producing uranium metal, a material vital for nuclear weapons. Iran says it is doing so for civilian purposes.<br />The disclosure came a week after Iran made one of its biggest steps yet to breach the 2015 deal, announcing it had begun enriching uranium at 20% purity. That crosses a red line European powers that are still party to the accord have previously set.<br />The most recent disclosure of plans to produce uranium metal—which has limited civilian utility—has stirred concern among Western officials over whether Iran is preparing to restart work toward a nuclear weapon.<br />Uranium metal is often used in the core of nuclear weapons. Production of the material, which hasn’t yet started, would be a clear breach of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, in which it agreed to a 15-year moratorium on uranium and plutonium metallurgical production.</td>

Prosecutors hope it will mark a turning point in the fight against the ‘Ndrangheta by targeting the leadership of one of its most prominent clans and exposing how the organization has infiltrated local politics and business.<br />The ‘Ndrangheta has steadily risen to become one of the world’s most powerful drug-trafficking syndicates, controlling over 80% of Europe’s cocaine trade. Its tentacles extend to the Americas, Africa and Australia.<br />The organization’s estimated annual revenue of $55 billion, according to prosecutors, is greater than estimates for the drug cartels of Mexico and Colombia combined. It is thought to have some 20,000 members. Yet it remains much less well-known than the Cosa Nostra. Prosecutors hope the trial will reveal details of its internal structure and workings.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The federal budget gap widened in the first three months of the fiscal year, as government spending continued to outpace revenues while the economy slowly recovers from the pandemic-induced downturn.<br />The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday the deficit from October through December totaled a record $573 billion, a 61% increase from the same period a year earlier. Federal outlays rose 18%, to $1.4 trillion, driven higher primarily by automatic safety-net spending such as jobless benefits, nutrition assistance and health care. Total receipts held steady, at $803 billion, the Treasury said.<br />For the 12 months that ended in December, the government ran a $3.3 trillion deficit, more than triple the shortfall a year earlier and roughly 15.8% of U.S. gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output.<br />Government spending surged last year as Congress authorized several measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic and cushion the U.S. economy from recession, and federal revenues declined as businesses closed and millions of Americans lost their jobs. The Labor Department said last week the U.S. lost 140,000 jobs last month, ending a seven-month streak of job creation as virus outbreaks across the country prompted a new round of business restrictions.<br />Lawmakers authorized another $908 billion economic relief package last month, but Treasury officials said the government didn’t begin distributing the money—including stimulus checks—until this month, and it isn’t reflected in the figures released Wednesday.</td>

      <td>OVER THE past year, as many Americans began working from home—and letting their style standards dip—fashion and footwear brands from  Nike  to Gucci began pumping out inviting, slide-on shoes. Many were peculiar, backless models. These “you don’t even need to lift your heel” mules might suit a life of slovenly at-home shuffling. But are any stylish enough to wear outside? Men’s fashion editor Jacob Gallagher and sports columnist Jason Gay debate the issue.<br />Jason: Can we talk about slippers? Sweatpants and hoodies dominated spring quarantine-chic, but now that it’s winter, it’s all about slippers. Slippers are the new sweatpants. Discuss.<br />Jacob: Slippers keep you warm. That’s the practical justification but here’s the truth: We’ve all become lazy. Tying laces? That’s a chore. And no one’s going anywhere fancy. So slippers carry the day. Shuffle out in them to the store. No one will judge you.<br />Jason: Slippers are a blissfully lazy option. And I was perfectly capable of being lazy before the pandemic—I was lazy before it was cool. However, to me, a slipper is strictly a stay-at-home option. You can wear slides outside, but a slipper is never-touches-pavement footwear. Once a slipper goes outside, it’s ruined. Jacob, are you wandering around the supermarket in slippers?<br />Jacob: Never in true slippers, but in summer I did wear pool slides inside and out. I’ve since moved on to closed-toed, backless rubber Birkenstocks, which have proved warmer. They’re enticingly lazy, but if your vision is bad enough they kinda look like loafers. At least, that’s what I tell myself. Where do you fall on mules like that?</td>

The IAEA said Tehran had given it no timeline for when it would do so. Still, the development brings Iran closer to crossing the line between nuclear operations with a potential civilian use, such as enriching nuclear fuel for power-generating reactors, and nuclear-weapons work, something Tehran has long denied ever carrying out.<br />Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharib Abadi, said Wednesday on Twitter that Iran would produce uranium metal, saying it would allow the development of a new fuel for the Tehran civilian research reactor. Iran has said it would take four to five months to install the equipment to produce a uranium powder from which uranium metal is made.</td>

Their 2020 season ended meekly, almost two weeks ago, with a modest triumph over the calamitous Jets. It was New England’s seventh win against nine losses, the franchise’s first losing record in 20 years.<br />Not very good. Not at all Patriots.<br />Still, Belichick expected to be busy this week. He was supposed to be in Washington, D.C., to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, from the outgoing President Trump. As everyone knows now, he won’t.

In a statement, Belichick made reference to the “tragic events” last week at the U.S. Capitol, and said “remaining true to the people, team and country I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award.”<br />Now Belichick has an empty spot in his calendar.

      <td>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio moved to cancel three contracts with the Trump Organization following the Capitol riot that have led organizations big and small to cut ties with President Trump and his family business.<br />The city said Wednesday it would begin the process of terminating agreements with the Trump Organization to operate two ice-skating rinks and a carousel in Central Park as well as the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point golf course in the Bronx.<br />Revenue from the businesses is relatively small. The mayor’s move to remove Mr. Trump’s company from operating the well-known sites in the president’s hometown is more symbolic.<br />“The City of New York will not be associated with those unforgivable acts in any shape, way or form, and we are immediately taking steps to terminate all Trump Organization contracts,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a press release.<br />The announcement follows a similar move by the PGA of America on Sunday to cancel plans to hold the 2022 PGA Championship at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, citing risks to the PGA’s brand of being associated with Mr. Trump.</td>

      <td>An Aaron Sorkin film celebrates the Chicago Seven for plotting an attack on a party convention.</td>
      <td>The Chicago Seven were countercultural heroes in the 1960s. They thumbed their noses through one of the country’s most notorious political trials, taunting the judge and making a mockery of the proceedings with flippant courtroom pranks. Aaron Sorkin wrote and directed a movie about them last year, “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” which will probably win a few Oscars.<br />One thing people forget about the Chicago Seven is that most of them were guilty. Jerry Rubin admitted as much later: “We wanted disruption. We planned it. . . . We were guilty as hell. Guilty as charged.”<br />The crime they were accused of was crossing state lines to incite a riot. The defendants believed that Vice President Hubert Humphrey’s 1968 nomination for presidency was illegitimate. Nominations in those days were decided not by primaries but by backroom deals among party power brokers. The antiwar movement believed that a more democratic process would have produced a candidate opposed to the Vietnam War.<br />The question was whether the violent clashes between protesters and police outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago were an unfortunate consequence of peaceful marching that got out of hand, or whether the organizers intended for things to get violent.<br />In February 1970, a jury convicted the five ringleaders—Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, Tom Hayden, David Dellinger and Rennie Davis. Peaceful protest is one thing, but attempting to disrupt a legitimate election procedure by violent intimidation is never acceptable. After last week’s incursion at the Capitol, can the rest of us finally agree?</td>

      <td><br />Poshmark Inc.,  the online marketplace for secondhand goods, is set to go public as early as Thursday, the latest e-commerce site to tap the buoyant initial public offering market as the coronavirus pandemic continues to squeeze bricks-and-mortar stores.<br />A number of digital marketplaces, including Poshmark, reported more people selling goods in spring 2020 as a way to generate extra income and stave off boredom during widespread lockdowns. Poshmark sellers list everything from $17 reusable Starbucks cups to $3,000 Louis Vuitton handbags. While many traditional apparel companies struggled to survive, Poshmark was profitable for the first time in its 10-year history during the quarter that ended June 30.<br />Poshmark is expected to price its IPO on Wednesday. It has set a price range of $35 to $39, giving the company a valuation of roughly $2.7 billion at the midpoint of that range. The business was valued at $1.25 billion in 2019. Poshmark declined to comment, citing a regulatory quiet period ahead of its IPO.<br />The Redwood City, Calif.-based company follows  ContextLogic Inc.,  the parent of e-commerce marketplace Wish, which has traded below its IPO price of $24 after a rocky debut last month. The investor skepticism is an anomaly in an otherwise booming IPO market that has seen sky-high valuations and large gains from tech companies including  Airbnb Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.</td>

      <td>Two apps—Signal and Telegram—are currently the No. 1 and No. 2 free app downloads in Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. Millions of users flocked to the chat apps in recent weeks, according to data from Apptopia and Sensor Tower. There are a few factors behind the surge.<br />One is concern over a privacy-policy update for the  Facebook Inc. -owned WhatsApp. Meanwhile, the deplatforming of President Trump from prominent social networks following the U.S. Capitol riot has driven people to seek communication tools without moderators and external visibility.<br />On Jan. 7,  Tesla Inc.  Chief Executive Elon Musktweeted, “Use Signal.” A subsequent flood of users caused the app’s phone-number verification system  to break temporarily. Days later,  Twitter Inc.  CEO Jack Dorseypublished a screenshot of Signal at the top of the App Store charts, along with a heart emoji. At the same time, influential accounts on Parler, the social network popular among conservatives, called on followers to move to Telegram. Donald Trump Jr. actively posts in a public channel on the app.<br />What do Signal and Telegram have in common? Both are chat apps that offer end-to-end encryption outside of Big Tech’s grasp. Encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Telegram can offer more security, privacy and features than plain text messaging—but their encryption methods and data collection vary. Meanwhile, WhatsApp and  Apple Inc.’s  iMessage also offer end-to-end encryption, but within their respective ecosystems.<br />Here’s how to choose an encrypted chat app, and why you might want to.</td>

It continued to hover near that level Wednesday. The metric shows an average expectation for price increases over five years.<br />“This is quite a remarkable move, it has surprised us,” said Jorge Garayo, a rates and inflation strategist at  Société Générale .<br />Forecasts for higher prices are playing out in the bond market. Germany’s 10-year break-even rate, or the difference in yield between its benchmark bond and a price level-linked bond, climbed above 1% for the first time since February.

Essentially, a higher break-even rate suggests investors expect prices to rise faster.<br />“With the onset of vaccines, people are upgrading their growth outlooks,” said  UBS  rates strategist Rohan Khanna.</td>

      <td>The things that have kept inflation low during the Covid-19 crisis are a lot different than the ones that used to keep it low. A whipsawing of prices when the pandemic passes is something to look out for.<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that U.S. consumer prices rose 0.4% in December from November, putting them 1.4% above their year earlier level. Core prices, which exclude food and energy items to better capture inflation’s trend, rose 0.1% from November, and were up 1.6% on the year.<br />The Federal Reserve’s aim is for 2% inflation, and the consumer price measures it follows run cooler than the Labor Department’s.<br />Under inflation’s hood, though, there are some big shifts. Prices for food at home—groceries and the like—remain elevated as a result of the pandemic, and were up 3.9% in December from a year earlier. Meanwhile, prices for lodging at hotels and the like were down 11.2%.<br />Those are reflections of a broader trend in which goods prices have risen on the back of stronger demand during the pandemic while services inflation has cooled substantially. Core goods prices were up 1.7% on the year last month, which compared with a December 2019 gain of 0.1%. Core services prices were up 1.6%, which compared with a December 2019 gain of 3%.</td>

      <td>Beyond the impulse to get a cheap deal, it is unclear why the Canadian owner of Circle K gas stations might want to buy French supermarket Carrefour</td>
      <td>On the surface, Alimentation  Couche-Tard ’s  interest in French grocery chain Carrefour looks odd. One possible explanation is that the Canadian gas-station retailer has spotted an opportunity to reduce its dependence on fuel sales, at a time when European supermarket valuations look cheap.<br />Carrefour shares were up 15% Wednesday after Europe’s third-largest food retailer by market capitalization said it was in talks with the acquisitive Canadian business. Couche-Tard, which owns the Circle K brand of convenience stores, subsequently said it had made a nonbinding offer of almost $20 billion—a 29% premium to Tuesday’s market value. For the strategic rationale, it said only that it was “focused on creating stakeholder value.”<br />Buying Carrefour would be a surprising pivot. As recently as November, the Quebec-based company told shareholders that it was focused on doing deals in the U.S. and Asia, with no mention of European expansion. Entry into the extremely competitive French grocery market is hardly appealing, although Carrefour also has sizable businesses in Argentina and Brazil. There is no geographic overlap between the two companies, so it is difficult to see how a tie-up could generate many cost savings.<br />The French grocery company is cheap, however. As a multiple of projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Carrefour’s enterprise value—market value plus net debt—was six times before news of the approach broke. Other European supermarkets, such as  Tesco  and Ahold-Delhaize, also fetch low valuations. But Carrefour in particular has struggled for years to reduce its dependency on “hypermarkets,” a supersize format that has fallen out of fashion.<br />Couche-Tard traded for 9.5 times before news of its approach sent the stock down 10% in early Toronto trading Wednesday. If the company could persuade Carrefour investors to accept stock, it would make the deal math more attractive even without big synergies. However, the Canadian company said Wednesday that it expected to pay mostly in cash. With net debt of roughly 1.1 times Ebitda, Couche-Tard can afford to increase its leverage.</td>

      <td>PARIS—Canada’s  Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.  said it has made a 16.1-billion-euro offer, equivalent to $19.66 billion, to buy French hypermarket chain  Carrefour SA,  as large retailers come under pressure to transform their bricks-and-mortar footprint amid pandemic restrictions on shopping and disruption from tech giants.<br />A merger would combine two companies with very different formats and geographical footprints into a $53 billion giant, making it the world’s third-largest grocery retailer, behind  Walmart Inc.  and Lidl owner Schwarz Group. Retailers are in a rush to find new ways to get food to customers ordering online as the spread of Covid-19 has massively accelerated online grocery shopping, including click-and-collect.<br />Carrefour—which opened its first store in 1960—is one of Europe’s largest grocery retailers. It also operates hypermarkets and supermarkets in Asia and Latin America. The 31-year-old Couche-Tard is the largest independent convenience store operator in North America by number of stores, operating under brands such as the Corner Store, Circle K and Holiday. It also operates a network of gas stations in Europe and has stores there and elsewhere in the world.<br />Carrefour shares were up 15.5% in Paris on Wednesday. Couche-Tard shares were down 10.05% in Toronto.<br />Jefferies analyst James Grzinic said he was a little blindsided by the talks, saying it was hard to map out synergies because overlap between the retailers is virtually nonexistent. He described the talks as a major departure from Couche-Tard’s stated strategy of maintaining return on capital employed at above 15%.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats take control of the White House and Senate this month with a large economic-relief package and $2,000 stimulus checks atop their agenda. But their slim majorities and procedural constraints will challenge their ability to design and pass those measures quickly.<br />The weeks ahead are critical for the new Democratic majorities as they try to deliver on campaign promises and shore up an uneven economic recovery. This period will test President-elect Joe Biden’s rhetoric about bipartisanship as Democrats determine how much they will work with Republicans and how they use the limited but powerful legislative tools they have to muscle their agenda through without the other party. Mr. Biden will release his detailed coronavirus relief plan Thursday and call for trillions of dollars from Congress.<br />“This is a chance to come in with a Democratic president who’s making a fresh start at a time when I think it’s understood that there are urgent needs and reforms that shouldn’t wait,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who is poised to be chairman of the Finance Committee. “[We can] really go on the offensive and really deal with some of the urgent economic needs that face working people.”<br />Mr. Wyden favors stimulus checks, pandemic-related health spending and expanded unemployment insurance tied to economic conditions instead of calendar deadlines.<br />Democrats agree broadly—but not universally—that a priority is to increase the $600 checks approved in December to $2,000, and they promised to do so if they won the Senate runoffs in Georgia. A report last week showing that employers shed 140,000 jobs in December, snapping seven months of employment gains, is adding to the pressure, though those losses came before December’s roughly $900 billion relief law was enacted.</td>

Even though coronavirus infections and deaths continue to escalate, luxury-travel firm Virtuoso says inquiries about trips started to climb as soon as vaccines were approved last year.<br />Demand is double-barreled.

      <td>WASHINGTON—On the first day of this session of Congress, every single House Republican rallied behind Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in their vote for House speaker.<br />Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) ultimately won her fourth term as House speaker. However, it was a high-water mark of GOP support for the California Republican, whose unwavering alliance with President Trump and unexpected string of House GOP wins on Election Night brought him closer than ever before to his longtime goal of becoming speaker of the House.<br />Now, just 10 days later, Mr. McCarthy faces tensions within the House GOP and doubts in some Republican quarters about his own leadership over his refusal to publicly challenge Mr. Trump and his support for disputing President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory after a violent mob of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.<br />The question for both Mr. McCarthy and his party as a whole is whether the path back to power leads through spurning Mr. Trump, or continuing to embrace him. In a previously unthinkable move, Mr. McCarthy was asking other Republicans whether he should press Mr. Trump to resign, according to someone familiar with the discussions.<br />“This is more than an inflection point for the Republican Party and specifically House Republicans,” said former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida. The force of Mr. McCarthy’s personal charisma and deep relationships are “by far his greatest asset and it’s very powerful,” he said. “He has survived past challenges, but this is a low point in our country and he’s in the middle of it.”</td>

Concerns were raised that the deal could give the  LSE  undue market power over trading and clearing government bonds, interest rate derivatives, and the sale of financial data such as stock- and bond-price quotes.<br />LSE is betting on the Refinitiv deal, first announced in 2019, to help it create a financial data juggernaut. It has been diversifying its operations away from stock trading and other traditional exchange businesses toward clearing and higher-margin data services that feed the rise of quantitative trading and passive investing.<br />Still, the largest exchange company in Europe by market value agreed to several concessions to win regulatory approval for the tie-up.

The concessions—in place for 10 years—center on the LSE granting equal access to its venue data to all existing and future competitors, continuing clearing services in line with EU regulations despite Brexit and the saleBorsa Italiana Group. The concessions also include a dispute resolution system for third parties to go to if the LSE doesn’t comply with its commitments.<br />Following Britain’s breakoff from the European Union, the bloc is under pressure to bolster the capabilities of the continent’s financial institutions, some analysts say. The remedies for the LSE deal highlight that pressure: It potentially undercuts the exchange’s ability to generate additional revenue from the proposed deal in areas such as clearing and trading government bonds and derivatives, and cross-selling data and other products between its customers and those of Refinitiv.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The House was set to vote to impeach President Trump on Wednesday for an unprecedented second time, alleging he encouraged a mob to storm the U.S. Capitol as part of an effort to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s election win.<br />At least several Republicans are expected to join all Democrats in approving an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump with less than a week to go in his term, as law-enforcement officials nationwide are bracing for more potential violence in Washington and in state capitals. After the vote, expected in the afternoon, the matter would go to the Senate, where the date of a trial, and the level of Republican support, is uncertain.<br />The president, in his first public appearance since the Capitol riot last week, said Tuesday he had no regrets about his remarks to supporters. He called the efforts to remove him from office over his comments a continuation of what he has termed a Democrat witch hunt.<br />House Democrats’ article of impeachment  alleges that Mr. Trump “willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ‘if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.’”<br />Late Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence rejected a push from the House to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Mr. Trump over his role in the Capitol riot, setting in motion the House vote Wednesday.</td>

      <td>Insects are inching their way to becoming a menu item on European dining tables after the bloc’s food safety regulator approved mealworms as safe for human consumption.<br />Wednesday’s announcement means the grubs—actually beetle larvae—could soon be ground down and used as a protein-rich flour to make pasta and bread, or consumed whole in stir-frys and other recipes. The next steps involve getting marketing and labeling approvals, and for the European Commission to sign off on the European Food Safety Authority’s decision.<br />The ruling provides a lift for companies such as Micronutris, a French edible insect farm which filed the application, and other startups including AgriProtein of South Africa, Netherlands-based Protix, and another French company, Ynsect, which is building a new farm with production capacity of more than 100,000 tons of bugs a year.<br />The bigger question, perhaps, is whether Europeans will want to eat bugs—long a popular snack in parts of Asia and Latin America—even if they are ground down into flour.<br />Giovanni Sogari, a researcher into social and consumption patterns at the University of Parma in Italy said many might find it difficult at first. “There are cognitive reasons derived from our social and cultural experiences, the so-called ‘yuck factor,’ that make the thought of eating insects repellent to many Europeans,” he said. “With time and exposure such attitudes can change.”</td>

      <td>President-elect Joe Biden says he plans to detail Thursday the first major legislation of his incoming administration: a massive new stimulus and relief package meant to address the continuing economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Mr. Biden has called the $900 billion relief plan Congress passed three weeks ago a mere “down payment” on what is needed. Here’s what we know about the new administration’s emerging plan:<br />“It will be in the trillions of dollars,” Mr. Biden said Friday, arguing that more spending sooner will reduce the long-term economic damage from the shutdowns. Earlier that day, the Labor Department announced said that job creation had stalled in December and that the U.S. economy lost more than nine million jobs in 2020, the worst labor-market performance in records dating to 1939. The first broad pandemic relief plan, enacted by Congress in March, cost roughly $2 trillion.<br />Mr. Biden and Democratic legislative leaders have repeatedly endorsed $2,000 direct payments to most Americans, calling the $600 checks in the December bill insufficient. The Biden plan would likely add $1,400 to the earlier payments to reach $2,000 total.<br />Mr. Biden said Friday there would be “billions of dollars” to speed up vaccine distribution, “tens of millions of dollars to help reopen our schools,” and “tens of billions of dollars” to allow state and local governments to keep paying teachers, police officers and health workers. He cited extending unemployment insurance and rent relief, and suggested he wants to modify the small-business assistance program to ensure more aid for minority-owned businesses. He also reiterated his support for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current $7.25, though it is unclear if that will be part of the relief package.</td>

Verizon Communications Inc.  told staff this week it won’t require them to get vaccinated, and  CVS Health Corp. , whose pharmacists are distributing vaccines and are themselves eligible for doses, said it encourages but doesn’t mandate shots.<br />Many hourly workers face challenges in getting to vaccine appointments, from child-care needs and transportation limitations to scheduling constraints from holding multiple jobs.

The proposed all-cash transaction is valued at about $1.4 billion, Qualcomm said, before working capital and other adjustments.<br />Nuvia’s expertise in designing central processing units, Qualcomm said, would help it boost chip performance and power efficiency—characteristics that are vital to success in the hot 5G-networking market that Qualcomm has made a priority.<br />The San Diego-based chip company is also bolstering its talent pool with the planned acquisition, adding Nuvia’s staff and three founders, Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati and John Bruno. Mr. Williams was lead chip architect at Apple before decamping to start Nuvia two years ago. Mr. Gulati and Mr. Bruno both worked at Apple and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google unit before Nuvia.<br />“The Nuvia team are proven innovators,” said Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president who this month was named to replace Steve Mollenkopfas chief executive at midyear.</td>

Etsy’s stock has more than quadrupled over the past year. The seller of homemade goods is now valued at more than $23 billion, well over half the value of  eBay ,  despite the fact that it is predicted to generate less than 20% of the sales of its consumer-tech peer in the fourth quarter.<br />Etsy’s sky-high valuation has been earned through its rapid growth over the past few quarters. Sales in the second and third quarters grew an average of nearly 145% year on year, according to FactSet, and traffic and search trends from the last two months of the year suggest the fourth quarter will also be stellar.<br />Traffic to Etsy’s website rose an average of nearly 96% in November and December, according to SimilarWeb data, which Jefferies says is the highest level of monthly growth it has recorded from the company over the past two years. Meanwhile, growth in Google searches for Etsy also appears to have accelerated in the last two months of the year relative to October, though not as significantly. Together, these trends bode well for fourth-quarter results, which Etsy generally reports in late February.<br />But investors might want to start asking themselves whether year-end outperformance is now baked into the stock, and just how long Etsy can continue to grow at the meteoric pace necessary to maintain its current valuation.</td>

      <td>The Republican Party has already seen its share of corporate PAC donations shrink compared with eight years ago</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The challenge by some Republicans to the 2020 election results last week is fueling a rift between the party and big companies and could accelerate changes to the GOP’s fundraising base.<br />In the week since more than 100 Republicans objected to the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s win, at least a dozen U.S. corporations said they would reconsider donating money from their political-action committees to lawmakers who sided with President Trump’s challenge to the results. Dozens more have said they are halting all political giving in response to the events last week, when supporters of Mr. Trump attacked the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying Mr. Biden’s victory.<br />The Republican Party has already seen its share of corporate PAC donations shrink compared with eight years ago, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. In the 2012 election, after the GOP had won control of the House during the Obama administration, Republicans received 63% of the $365 million total given by business PACs. In 2020, Republicans got 57% of corporate PAC donations.<br />Employees in some key business sectors have also shifted their political giving toward Democrats, data from the Center for Responsive Politics indicates. Between the 2012 and 2020 elections, Republicans have seen declines in the share of donations to candidates, PACs and party committees from employees in the securities and investment, finance, business services and real-estate sectors.<br />In the Senate, where Republicans will try to win back the majority in the next election, some Republican lobbyists and business executives said they are worried about facing backlash if they steer company PAC donations to the GOP’s campaign committee, which is run by Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.), who objected to the certification of Mr. Biden’s election. Outside political groups, such as one affiliated with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), are also expected to take a hit.</td>

At the same time, videogaming, social video on apps like TikTok and digital fitness have taken off—each with opportunities labels, publishers and other copyright owners are eyeing for music.<br />The digital fitness market has taken off with  Peloton Interactive Inc.’s  stationary bikes,  Lululemon Athletica Inc.’s  purchase of Mirror,  Apple Inc.’s  introduction of Fitness+, as well as upstarts like Supernatural VR and Hydrow.<br />Equinox launched its Variis mobile app in March, giving its bricks-and-mortar gym members free access to virtual classes just as stay-at-home orders and lockdown restrictions were sweeping through cities across the country.

The move essentially combined a few of 2020’s hottest trends: a SPAC, a disruptive touchless technology and housing fever. Together, they have brought much hype to an unproven business that might have lost a key competitive edge.<br />While the onset of the pandemic temporarily derailed the iBuying business, which is focused on buying and reselling homes electronically, more recent trends have played to its strengths. Low interest rates and the rise of remote work have brought new buyers into the market, while skyrocketing home prices have enticed homeowners to try to cash out while demand is hot.<br />Opendoor shares closed their first day of trading on their own in December with a market value of roughly $17 billion based on the number of shares outstanding listed in a filing last month. That is up from a post-money valuation of just $3.8 billion following the company’s last venture raise early in 2019, according to PitchBook.<br />Having launched in 2014, Opendoor had established a sizable first-mover advantage in the iBuying market, with revenue growing 158% to $4.7 billion in 2019. That compares with just $1.4 billion in 2019 revenue for Zillow’s iBuying business.</td>

Store-based sales increased 4.2%, while digital sales more than doubled during that period, driven by same-day online pickup and delivery orders, the company said.<br />“The momentum in our business continued in the holiday season with notable market share gains across our entire product portfolio,” Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said in a statement. Target has invested heavily in recent years to expand its online business largely by sourcing online orders from stores’ shelves. Around 95% of Target sales in the period were sourced from stores, the company said.<br />Retailers are reporting mixed holiday results. Target and other large retailers have generally performed well during the pandemic. Most of the top performers are retailers that either stayed open during early lockdowns or those that sell food, home goods or other products that are increasingly in demand as more shoppers stay home. Many of the top performers had robust e-commerce businesses already in place before the pandemic and are now benefiting as more shopping shifts online.<br />Earlier this week  Lululemon Athletica Inc.  raised its fourth-quarter financial guidance after a strong holiday season as more shoppers bought athletic gear and comfortable clothing.</td>

But most vanilla financiers have more to lose than win by diving into digital assets.<br />Open interest in  CME ’s  bitcoin futures has surged by more than 250% since the beginning of October. Large trade sizes and the fact that bitcoin doesn’t have to be held directly mean CME’s system is considered a benchmark of activity by institutional investors.<br />Crypto-focused hedge funds and individual buyers are free to invest as they like, of course. Buying a volatile asset without cash flow in a euphoric market is a risk they are willing to take. It has certainly paid off for those with iron stomachs.<br />The calculation for mainstream institutions should be very different. Many will take a small allocation that will make little difference to their bottom line if prices surge, but they will still be left to explain to clients why they invested in an entirely speculative asset if things go sour. By investing in such small amounts, they are crossing the Rubicon without getting to enter Rome.<br />Eighty-one percent of investment into the funds run by Grayscale Investments in the third quarter came from institutional investors, according to the company.

      <td>Delays in administering Covid-19 vaccine shots pose a fresh risk to investors who bet on a speedy vaccination process to help risky U.S. companies bounce back from the pandemic.<br />The approval of coronavirus vaccines made by  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  last year propelled rescue financing packages for several cash-strapped companies, supplying them with what investors thought would be enough liquidity to keep them afloat until widespread immunity took hold.  Cineworld Group  PLC,  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,   Carnival Corp.  and other companies with bleak outlooks because of the pandemic found financial lifelines to tide them over.<br />These deals continued a trend dating back months before the vaccines were approved, as actions taken by the Federal Reserve and Congress, coupled with investors’ eagerness to continue lending, kept the corporate default rate well below analysts’ expectations.<br />But the sluggish rollout of the vaccines is now undermining the timeline that investors projected when extending emergency credit. The U.S. government fell well short of its goal of vaccinating 20 million Americans in 2020, having administered just 2.8 million doses by the end of last year, according to federal figures, in part due to differing state policies that have led to confusion and shipment delays. The emergence of the more-contagious U.K. coronavirus mutation in the U.S. has also raised the likelihood of further government restrictions and consumers being more cautious about leaving their homes.<br />So far, more than 25.4 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, but only 8.9 million Americans have received a shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</td>

      <td>Congressional Democrats have urged Biden to forgive most or all of Americans’ student debt unilaterally</td>
      <td>Trump administration lawyers have concluded that it would be illegal to forgive all or some of Americans’ student debt through an executive action—as congressional Democrats have urged the incoming Biden administration to do—arguing that such a move would require Congress to pass a law.<br />Education Department lawyers lay out their reasoning in a memo dated Tuesday to Betsy DeVos, who resigned last week as education secretary. The internal agency memo, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, was signed by a political appointee and isn’t binding.<br />Congressional Democrats and progressive groups have urged President-elect Joe Biden to forgive most or all of the $1.6 trillion in federal student debt unilaterally in his first 100 days in office. They argue that existing law authorizes the executive branch to forgive student debt without any action from Congress.<br />“We believe the Secretary does not have the statutory authority to cancel, compromise, discharge, or forgive, on a blanket or mass basis, principal balances of student loans, and/or to materially modify the repayment amounts or terms thereof,” Reed Rubinstein, the Education Department’s principal deputy general counsel, wrote in the memo to Mrs. DeVos. Mr. Rubinstein’s tenure will end along with those of other appointees when the new administration takes office Jan. 20.<br />Mr. Biden, a Democrat, has said he supports writing off $10,000 in student debt for every borrower as part of a package of measures to help households financially during the pandemic. About 43 million Americans owe $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.</td>

      <td>In latest annual trust survey, U.S. respondents back business at a higher percentage than other institutions</td>
      <td>People have more faith in their own employer than leaders in government and business, according to a new study released Wednesday.<br />Overall, trust in institutions remains low, but business earned the highest marks, said the annual survey by the public-relations firm Edelman. The poll represented the company’s 21st analysis of public trust in major institutions and surveyed more than 33,000 people in 28 countries over the past several months.<br />More than half of U.S. respondents, 54%, said they trust business, which was more than was said for nongovernmental organizations, government or media. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. respondents said their own employer, in particular, was a mainstay of trust.<br />“Business has to help the country knit itself back together, to be the connective tissue, while the politics are sorted out,” said Richard Edelman, the company’s chief executive.<br />The findings continue a trend. Last year’s poll also showed crumbling trust in institutions amid anxiety about corruption, future employment prospects and the wage gap between the rich and middle classes.</td>

      <td>Hedge funds score gains when blank-check companies rise after announcing deals to take startups public</td>
      <td>Sudden excitement about the flurry of startups going public through so-called blank-check companies is enriching some of the biggest players in finance, particularly hedge funds.<br />The gains come through the unique rights given to early investors in special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which look to acquire promising startups and take them public. As the vehicles become more popular, the hedge funds that invest in them early on, such as Magnetar Capital, Glazer Capital and Israel Englander’s Millennium Management, can earn lofty returns without much risk.<br />Here is how the trade typically works: Hedge funds give the SPAC money for up to two years while it looks for a merger target. In return, they get a unique right to withdraw their investment before a deal goes through that minimizes any loss on the trade. At the same time, the potential return for early investors is huge if the SPAC shares rise because they also initially receive shares and warrants giving them the right to buy more shares at a specified price in the future.<br />Wall Street’s recent exuberance has engulfed SPACs, with day traders and large institutions alike pouring money into shell companies pursuing startups tied to themes such as green energy or sports betting. Recent SPACs have surged immediately after announcing deals to take startups public, giving the hedge funds opportunities to sell and turn quick profits.<br />One example came Jan. 7, when shares of the venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya’s  Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V  advanced 63% after it said it is combining with Social Finance Inc. to take the financial-technology company public.</td>

That puts it well ahead of the S&P 500, the MSCI World and the Euro Stoxx indexes, despite the U.K. being among the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The recent market rally doesn’t make up for its stark underperformance since the U.K. voted to leave Europe in 2016. In dollar terms, the FTSE 100 is still below where it closed on June 23, 2016, the day of the Brexit referendum.<br />Britain did manage to conclude a slim new trade deal with the European Union on Christmas Eve, eliminating fears that it might break away from the bloc at the end of 2020 with all its exports subject to tariffs and restrictions. But the bare-bones deal leaves much to be negotiated. The British pound hasn’t benefited either, confounding those who believe that U.K. assets are now more attractive.<br />As investors move money into U.K. assets, they need to buy the British currency, and that should lift the pound. Savvas Savouri, chief economist at Toscafund Asset Management, a $4 billion hedge fund, believes the pound’s fundamental value in euros is about €1.30 apiece. But since Dec. 23, it remained flat at €1.11 before rising to €1.12 on Wednesday.</td>

Boeing didn’t acknowledge any wrongdoing.<br />The settlement comes less than a week after Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of a settlement resolving a criminal charge that it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the agency’s safety review of the 737 MAX jet. Prosecutors laid out a pattern of activity by two Boeing pilots to deceive regulators about a software system that ultimately led to two crashes in which a total of 346 people died.<br />Boeing acknowledged responsibility in that case, agreeing to pay a $244 million fine and pledging to tighten internal ethics rules and compliance standards.</td>

Mimecast, in a Tuesday blog post, said the hackers were able to obtain a digital certificate used by the company to access its customers’  Microsoft  365 office productivity services.<br />The Mimecast hackers used tools and techniques that link them to the hackers who broke into Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds Corp., according to people familiar with the investigation. The link to the SolarWinds hackers was reported earlier by Reuters.<br />U.S. government officials have blamed Russia for the SolarWinds attack. Moscow has denied involvement.<br />Most of the companies and government agencies identified as victims to date were compromised via a piece of network management software called Orion that belongs to SolarWinds. But the Mimecast case, in which the vendor’s customers became targets, highlights that not all victims had to be SolarWinds users themselves to be targeted.</td>

But the Trump administration, which opposes abortion rights, left in place regulations requiring women to make in-person visits to a hospital, clinic or physician’s office to pick up mifepristone, one of two drugs used to induce a medication abortion.<br />The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an organization of women’s health-care physicians, and other groups sued the FDA over its exclusion of mifepristone, also known by the brand name Mifeprex.<br />The group’s president, Dr. Eva Chalas, said patients should be able to obtain mifepristone, like other drugs, through mail delivery.</td>

      <td>The storming of the U.S. Capitol last week has left millions of Americans wondering about the health of their democracy. Now imagine the damage if this is followed by political violence across the country leading up to the inauguration.<br />That’s the worry caused by an FBI warning about armed protests planned for all 50 states and the U.S. Capitol starting Jan. 16—with a threat of a “huge uprising” if President Trump is removed via the 25th amendment.<br />The warning comes via an internal FBI bulletin that reads in part: “On 8 January, the FBI received information on an identified group calling for others to join them in ‘storming’ state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event POTUS is removed as President prior to Inauguration Day. This identified group is also planning to ‘storm’ government offices including in the District of Columbia and in every state, regardless of whether the states certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump, on 20 January.”<br />It’s hard to know what to make of this without insight into the actors, but after last week governors, mayors and police will have to take it seriously. That means mobilizing the resources and manpower to keep law enforcement from being overwhelmed.<br />The moment also requires calls for restraint and nonviolence from both the left and right. Steve Scalise, the second-ranking Republican in the House and himself a victim of a politically motivated shooter, makes his plea nearby for politicians to tone down rhetoric that can inspire violence.</td>

      <td>Most Americans know little about modern Asian history. That’s too bad—yesterday’s upheavals are likely to be tomorrow’s, too.</td>
      <td>Modern Asian history may be the most important subject that most educated Americans know almost nothing about. With the center of gravity of world politics now firmly located in the Indo-Pacific, many are looking for ways to deepen their understanding of the most populous, fastest-growing and potentially most dangerous region in the world. Tim Harper’s “Underground Asia: Global Revolutionaries and the Assault on Empire” is an excellent place to start. It is a clearly written, brilliantly researched examination of the people and movements that shaped Asia’s course in the 20th century and continue to influence the continent today.<br />In the early part of the century, when Mr. Harper’s narrative begins, European colonialism seemed permanently established in Asia. In 1906, the power of the Netherlands in what is now Indonesia reached its grim apogee as Dutch forces shelled the royal capital of the ancient Balinese kingdom of Badung until the battered, unarmed defenders, in a final act of defiance, “processed out of the palace and threw themselves, singing, at the Dutch automatic weapons.” An estimated 1,000 were killed.<br />The early arrival of the Industrial Revolution had given western nations, especially Britain, what appeared to be an insurmountable industrial, economic, political and military supremacy. Prospectors, planters, industrialists, missionaries and soldiers descended on traditional Asian societies and, shunting hapless native rulers aside almost everywhere, began to modernize Asia to suit western needs. Steamship lines connected ports; vast urban complexes grew up where trade routes crossed; and railroads carried the agents, the goods and the ideas of empire deep into the countryside.<br />European power in Asia looked unshakable, but only 43 years after the fall of Badung the Dutch were forced to recognize Indonesian independence amid the abject regional collapse of European rule.<br />How Asia’s ragtag revolutionaries turned that fierce desire for freedom into movements that could overcome European advantages in technology and organization is the story Mr. Harper wants to tell. It’s an ambitious assignment. Then as now, Asia was an overwhelmingly diverse region, and those differences were in many cases exacerbated by the ways that French, Dutch, British and Japanese colonialism overwrote preexisting cultural linkages with new patterns and influences. Often relying on colonial police archives, Mr. Harper reconstructs the obscure lives of the revolutionary generation who hammered out the ideas and built the movements that would lead Asia through the astonishingly rapid destruction of some of the largest and most powerful empires the world had ever seen.</td>

This should speed up vaccinations by putting more pressure on states to relax the bureaucratic and political controls that have slowed the rollout.<br />“Every vaccine dose that is sitting in a warehouse rather than going into an arm could mean one more life lost or one more hospital bed occupied,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a press briefing. He’s right. Only 9.3 million of the 27.7 million vaccine doses that have been shipped to states have been administered.<br />Blame convoluted and rigid eligibility rules that have focused too much on “equity”—i.e., politics. Operation Warp Speed apportions doses to states, and then states decide how to allocate them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance to states on how to prioritize vaccines focuses on worker occupation, but many states have added to the morass.<br />New York has been one of the worst, creating a complex formula for ranking health-care employees based on underlying risk factors, age, occupation and hospital department, among other things. Many hospitals had spare vaccines because large numbers of health-care workers declined to be vaccinated. Yet state rules barred offering shots to others.<br />The  Pfizer  and Moderna mRNA shots have to be used within hours of opening vials. When hospitals and clinics had leftover shots after vaccinating everyone who wanted one, nurses often had to go on a scavenger hunt to find someone in the Governor’s top priority group. Many doses went to waste, and hundreds were left unopened on shelves.</td>

      <td>Obama’s engagement failed to change Havana’s behavior.</td>
      <td>After a five-year hiatus, the State Department on Monday returned Cuba to its list of state sponsors of terrorism. What took so long?<br />State’s practice of listing countries that “have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism” has been in place since 1979. President Reagan added the tropical communist regime in 1982. Cuba remained so designated until President Obama removed it from the list in 2015 in its campaign to normalize relations. But Havana doesn’t want to be normal, and it has deepened and broadened its commitment to terrorism.<br />The collapse of Venezuela’s democracy over two decades has been run out of Havana by Cuba’s military-intelligence apparatus. The once-sovereign South American nation is now essentially a Cuban satellite used as a base for transnational crime and terrorism. A 2019 report by the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism found that “Cuba and Venezuela continued to provide permissive environments for terrorists.”<br />The report noted that “individuals linked” to dissident members of the Colombian drug-trafficking group FARC, “who remain committed to terrorism notwithstanding the peace accord,” as well as the smaller rebel National Liberation Army (ELN) and “Hizballah sympathizers” were in Venezuela. Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro, who survives in power thanks to Cuba, “has openly welcomed former FARC leaders who announced a return to terrorist activities,” the report said.<br />Cuba also welcomes and protects terrorists at home. “Members of the ELN who were in Havana to conduct peace talks with the Colombian government since 2017 also remained in Cuba,” the report found. “Cuba, citing peace negotiation protocols, refused Colombia’s request to extradite 10 ELN leaders after that group claimed responsibility for the January 2019 bombing of a Bogotá police academy, which killed 22 and injured 87 others.”</td>

      <td>A political group wants to make it easier to cancel Trump alumni.</td>
      <td>President Trump’s behavior last week is the fault of Mr. Trump and a small coterie who egged him on. So watch for efforts to exploit Americans’ outrage at the Capitol assault in service of tactics that seek to spread the blame far and wide for political or ideological ends.<br />Stuart Stevens, a senior advisor to the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, tweeted Saturday that “we are constructing a database of Trump officials & staff that will detail their roles in the Trump administration & track where they are now.” He added: “No personal info, only professional. But they will be held accountable & not allowed to pretend they were not involved.”<br />The Lincoln Project is a well-funded political action group, run mostly by former GOP consultants, that made ads for Democrats in the 2020 election cycle. We often disagreed, especially with the group’s effort to unseat principled GOP Senators, but never begrudged donors exercising their First Amendment right to influence the political process.<br />It’s something else to turn fire on former public servants in private life. Mr. Stevens tells us in an email that he’s doing nothing more than Wikipedia does with its pages listing past Administration alumni. But then why broadcast his stigmatizing intentions?<br />The only reason for an anti-Trump group to publicize the employment information of former officials is to deter employers from hiring them. If they are hired, progressive employees could scour the list and create petitions for them to be fired or doxed. This will deepen America’s civic strife.</td>

      <td>Danes face threats from Beijing for planning a fake climate crisis to help Ted Hui get to the West.</td>
      <td>‘We say the Chinese Communist Party got cheated by two Danish boys,” says Thomas Rohden, 25. Last month, he and his friend Anders Storgaard, 26, masterminded a plan to sneak a dissident out of Hong Kong. For pulling off a daring feat, they may face consequences that reveal much about Beijing’s global ambitions.<br />Messrs. Rohden and Storgaard belong to opposing political parties, but both are members of the Danish China Critical Society, a group focused on the Communist Party’s human-rights abuses. The two men met Hong Kong opposition members visiting Copenhagen last February. “That opened my eyes to how important it is for us young people who are democratically involved to stick together,” Mr. Storgaard says.<br />They kept in touch with Ted Hui, a 38-year-old pro-democracy lawmaker. All three are as mischievous as they are principled—Mr. Hui once set off a stink bomb during a Legislative Council session as an act of protest against legislation that threatened free expression.<br />Supporters of the freedom movement in Hong Kong have repeatedly been assaulted since 2019, and Mr. Hui noticed strangers had begun to follow him and his family. Police arrested him numerous times for protesting in the streets and in the Legislative Council. Mr. Hui got out on bail, but greater legal peril loomed. Last summer Beijing imposed a national-security law on Hong Kong that outlaws all forms of dissent, on penalty of life in prison. (Mr. Hui hasn’t been charged under that law.)<br />Messrs. Rohden and Storgaard contacted their friend after he was released on bail. Mr. Hui responded with a strange suggestion. As a former member of the Legislative Council’s Environmental Affairs Panel, he wanted to come to Denmark to talk about climate change. Beijing purports to care about the environment, and Mr. Storgaard and Mr. Rohden intuited this might be a chance for Mr. Hui to escape. So they made an audacious plan: to stage a fake climate conference in Copenhagen in early December, invite their friend, and get him to safety.</td>

      <td>The man who shot me in 2017 and the Capitol Hill rioters all were radicalized by extreme rhetoric.</td>
      <td>I’m still angry after last week’s events at the Capitol. I mourn for Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died from injuries inflicted by rioters, and worry about the morale and safety of his fellow officers. My concerns continue for the safety of my colleagues, staff and members of the press who work in Washington. President Trump should have denounced the attack unequivocally as it was taking place.<br />What happened last Wednesday went well beyond any candidate’s legal right to contest an election and is another glaring sign that public discourse has gotten out of control. With only days to go until President-elect Biden’s Inauguration, our national temperature is far too high. A powder keg had been smoldering long before Wednesday’s events. For the sake of our country, politicians and media figures—of both parties—have to tone down their rhetoric.<br />In 2017, I was shot on a baseball field by a politically motivated gunman. The deranged shooter was heavily influenced by the demonization of congressional Republicans by some Democratic politicians, whose statements were amplified by the mainstream media. In the aftermath of my shooting, I made a conscious decision not to hold anybody but the gunman responsible for that day’s events.<br />It would, however, be naive to think the shooter arrived at his decision in a vacuum. It would be equally naive to think that the Capitol rioters arrived at their decisions in a void. Violent rhetoric helps radicalize people. Republicans and Democrats alike must have the moral clarity to call this language out whenever it is spoken, not only when it comes from the other side of the political aisle.<br />Many Democrats who were rightfully quick to join us in condemning last week’s events at the Capitol were noticeably silent over the summer. In those months, Americans watched looters ransack small businesses while cities went up in flames. Radical progressives attacked police precincts and federal courthouses, and leftist protesters clashed repeatedly with police. In Minneapolis, Kenosha, Wis., Seattle’s “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,” the District of Columbia and other cities, many elected officials outright enabled a cruel disregard for life, property and the rule of law in the name of social justice. Many in the media cheered the violence. “Show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful,” CNN’s Chris Cuomo said.</td>

With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed.”<br />Judged against this standard, can impeaching President Trump and removing him from office succeed? A Quinnipiac University survey released on Monday suggests that it cannot.<br />Yes, 52% of Americans favor removing President Trump from office, compared with 45% who oppose it. But the partisan divisions are deep. While 89% of Democrats support this course, 87% of Republicans oppose it, and independents are split.<br />Underlying this stark divide are radically divergent interpretations of the November presidential election and its aftermath. Some 73% of Republicans believe that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Only 5% of Democrats do.<br />These dueling beliefs have consequences. Seventy-three percent of Republicans think that Mr. Trump’s actions since the election have aimed at protecting democracy; 95% of Democrats think that he has been undermining democracy.</td>

      <td>At border wall in Texas, president takes aim at House move to impeach him over his supporters’ violence at Capitol</td>
      <td>President Trump, speaking in public for the first time since he rallied his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol before the riot last week, attacked Democrats for seeking to impeach him again and aired grievances about  Twitter  and the incoming administration, in an event meant to showcase his immigration policy.<br />“The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country,” Mr. Trump said in Alamo, Texas. The House is preparing to cast a series of votes aimed at ousting or impeaching the president over his role in last week’s violence at the Capitol.<br />As concerns mount about the possibility of more riots around Inauguration Day, the president also called for “no violence,” after sending mixed messages on the riot in recent days. He condemned the violent protests in a taped video last week, before vowing that his supporters would “not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”<br />“We believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down,” Mr. Trump said. “We believe in the rule of law and not in violence.”<br />The president showed little regret for his actions ahead of last week’s riot, which followed a monthslong effort by Mr. Trump and his allies to rally his supporters with baseless claims of a rigged election. Speaking to reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before taking off for Texas, Mr. Trump denied any responsibility for the violence perpetrated by his supporters at the Capitol last week, saying his speech before the riot was “totally appropriate.”</td>

      <td>As herd immunity comes nearer, inoculate where it will do the most good.</td>
      <td>A new strain of the coronavirus is preliminarily and tentatively estimated to be 50% more transmissible than the current strain. This will be yet more incentive for those already highly motivated not to spread or catch it. Nobody really knows what “50% more” means in this context, but all the same social distancing and mask-wearing recommendations apply. If it takes 50% more diligence to achieve the same virus-suppressing effect, you see the problem: Many people already find the current level of diligence unsustainable or not worth their effort.<br />It is pretty apparent that, in countries where social distancing cannot be enforced by bayonet or mega-Trumpian border control, cases are growing faster than hospital capacity. The vaccine has not (contrary to my hope) caused many to redouble their efforts with a light at the end of the tunnel. Millions who know better than ever now that most cases are mild or symptomless seem to be telling themselves, with the elderly being vaccinated, their own job is done.<br />A typical sentence since last summer has been: I went to the grocery store and everybody was wearing a mask. The first part of the sentence is the problematic part. People are crowding together again. A decline in social distancing has defeated an increase in mask wearing.<br />Celebrity is fickle even if you’re a coronavirus mutation. By July, the dominant variant in the U.S. and Europe had become different from the Chinese strain that served as the basis for our then-hatching vaccines. As it turns out, the vaccines nevertheless are potent against the “G” strain and likely to be against the celebrated new mutation from the U.K. But it won’t be true of future variants. Once a vaccine starts going into millions of arms, that’s when selective pressure ramps up on a virus to defeat our vaccines. Interestingly, though scientists aren’t sure whether natural or artificial vaccination confers better immunity, they’re pretty sure the natural kind will prove more robust against evolution because it responds to a broader diversity of virus features.<br />More information is always helpful. Multiple experts, in honor of the newly recognized variant, want accelerated genomic sampling to hunt for new strains. Great idea. But it does underline our odd indifference toward measuring current spread accurately. Joe Biden, the Brits and others suddenly are realizing their dainty and over-categorizing answers about who should get the vaccine first are slowing its delivery. Also hurting is the likelihood that one-third of people soon to be lining up will already have been vaccinated by nature, many of them not knowing it.</td>

Scott Rechler, chief executive of RXR Realty, said that his company has identified six retail locations for Manhattan testing centers, one in a former Starbucks.<br />Mr. Rechler said the centers, which won’t be charging rent, will likely start opening in February and will all be open by the end of March. “The idea is to have the infrastructure in place in the middle of February and then by March, you’ll start seeing people come back to the workplace,” he said.<br />William Rudin, the head of one of the city’s real estate dynasties, said his company will likely provide at least two locations—one in Midtown Manhattan and the other in downtown—for Rudin office tenants.</td>

      <td>The complete recordings—all 775 hours—of the historic Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders has been released online.</td>
      <td>Hermann Göring’s German speaking voice is pinched, high-pitched, pedantic. He snaps condescendingly at the prosecutor who presents him with one wartime document after another: “I have to read it first.” “No, that is in no way correctly translated.” “Here is a mistake already.” “That is not quite correct.”<br />In these, his final public appearances—as a defendant in the International Military Tribunal Trial of Major War Criminals held in Nuremberg, Germany, from November 1945 to October 1946—he speaks with almost singsong mockery, as if he were looking down at lesser mortals. He relishes tweaking the U.S. chief prosecutor and justice of the Supreme Court, Robert H. Jackson, derailing his lines of questioning with challenges over trivia. Göring is so petty and pettifogging, you can almost forget that he had been the demonic creator of the Gestapo, the supreme commander of the Luftwaffe and Hitler’s chosen successor.<br />Göring was one of 24 high-level political and military Nazi leaders put on trial (two of the defendants never made it to the dock—one because of suicide, the other because of illness). Following the verdicts of judges from the four Allied powers (the U.S., Britain, France and the Soviet Union), 10 were hanged, three were acquitted and others were given long sentences. Martin Bormann—Hitler’s private secretary—rumored to be dead (as he was) was sentenced to death in absentia. And Göring notoriously cheated the executioner, killing himself the night before his scheduled trip to the gallows.<br />Hearing these voices as they accuse, excuse, avoid, rationalize and lie is quite different from reading the trial record. English transcripts have long been available as part of Yale University’s Avalon Project and as part of the Nuremberg records at the Library of Congress. Now, during the trial’s 75th anniversary, the complete recordings have been put online for the first time by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, along with the 37 reels of film introduced into evidence at the trial. The International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, the custodian of the original materials—1,942 gramophone discs containing 775 hours of hearings—arranged the digitization of its archive, collaborating with the Holocaust museum in Washington and the Mémorial de la Shoah in Paris.<br />It isn’t easy listening, and not only because the museum’s awkward web presentation makes any selective exploration difficult. While the trial employed simultaneous translation of German, English, French and Russian—the first time the technique was used on this scale—these recordings do not provide any benefit of translation or captioning; nonquadrilingual listeners must consult transcripts from other sites. But what is heard, even now, seems remarkable: a rough first draft of judgment, beginning just five months after the war with Germany ended and unfolding over nearly a year as its arbiters strained to fit minimal forms of existing law to maximal forms of moral degradation.</td>

      <td>Netflix’s grim four-part docuseries highlights the forensic work of detectives Frank Salerno and Gil Carrillo, who ultimately identified the erratic killer.</td>
      <td>That television is acrawl with serial killers probably says something unpleasant about our shared capacity for morbid fascination. It might even represent an extreme version of the “there-but-for-the-grace-of-God” attraction of so much reality TV. But some cases can stand up to repeated revisiting, notably that of the so-called Night Stalker, which has now been the subject of at least half a dozen film and TV adaptations, one of which starred Richard Jordan and A Martinez as detectives Frank Salerno and Gil Carrillo.<br />The real-life Carrillo and Salerno are the stars, so to speak, of the four-part Netflix series “Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,” which director Tiller Russell adorns with an excess of boogeyman visuals and ominous music, but which provides a cop’s-eye view of why the case remains so interesting. “We’d never encountered someone like that,” says Mr. Salerno, alluding to the methodologies of Richard Ramirez, which were so varied and random they offered up no immediate connections between the crimes or any obvious profile of the killer himself. Ramirez, who died in prison in 2013, shot people in their sleep, sexually assaulted his victims, beat them viciously, dragged one out of her car in traffic and shot her; he abducted children, molested them but let them live (usually) while killing his adult targets; he mutilated, burglarized and his weapons ranged from guns and knives to hammers and tire irons. Police investigators such as Messrs. Salerno and Carrillo were accustomed to suspects who exhibited specific homicidal pathologies. Ramirez, who terrorized Los Angeles and San Francisco in 1984 and ’85, seemed to have them all.<br />The process by which the detectives finally linked up the various crimes is the narrative engine of “Night Stalker,” which provides quite a bit of background on the police officers, and some crazily moody portraiture, but also gives us a glimpse inside the investigative mind. Mr. Carrillo tells us that during the course of his academic study of criminal psychology he learned that there was a certain deviancy that thrived on the frightened look on a victim’s face—something that had been a distinctive aspect of several of the crimes. Mr. Salerno, who was instrumental in cracking the Hillside Strangler case of the ’70s and so had considerable experience with multiple murderers, recalls Ramirez committing one home invasion in which he stopped, mid-mayhem, to fix himself something to eat. “That’s a pretty sick individual,” Mr. Salerno says, not meaning to be funny.<br />The tracking of the killer’s footprints—left by what turned out to be a pair of very distinctive Avia sneakers—becomes an obsession, both for the detectives and for us. It was also the kind of detail they had to strive to keep out of the media, lest Ramirez, who obviously followed his own coverage and left very few clues behind, stop wearing the shoes. The police cut deals with the press and TV outlets to keep certain details from the public, but they couldn’t control politicians: When it became clear that Ramirez had relocated to San Francisco, then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein held a news conference in which she “vomited” details of the crimes that had been shared by the two cities. The resentment of the cops seems as fresh today as it must have been then.<br />So, yes, there’s a bit of payback at play in “Night Stalker,” especially regarding the Los Angeles Police Department. Detectives Carrillo and Salerno, who were with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, recall several instances where information wasn’t shared, or incompetence ruled the day. A car that probably contained Ramirez’s fingerprints was kept in an outdoor LAPD lot, undusted, until its usefulness as evidence was destroyed. A dentist’s office to which Ramirez was sure to return—he had an impacted tooth—was staked out by Sheriff’s officers, but they were replaced for budgetary reasons by an LAPD alarm. The dentist was to use it if and when Ramirez returned. Which he did. And the alarm malfunctioned. “So we missed him,” Mr. Carrillo says, generously.</td>

      <td>Kyra Sedgwick stars as an over-intrusive, overly forward mom in ABC’s new sitcom.</td>
      <td>From June Cleaver, Edith Bunker and Clair Huxtable to Morticia Addams, Peg Bundy and Marge Simpson, the TV mom as an institution has been a source of warmth, solace and neuroses. While the characters in question were usually busy being moms, there have been empty-nesters, too, and ones with no sense of boundaries: Endora (“Bewitched”) would arrive unannounced in a puff of smoke; Marie Barone (“Everybody Loves Raymond”) lived next door, though one could hardly ever tell.<br />In “Call Your Mother,” Kyra Sedgwick plays Jean Raines, intrusive mother extraordinaire: When she can’t get her son, Freddie (Joey Bragg), on the phone for four days she packs her bags and leaves for Los Angeles. Are her relocated children happy to see her? Is it sunny in L.A.? What’s clear, partly through Ms. Sedgwick’s portrayal—a mix of Midwest nice and East Coast anxious—is that Jean is as eager to leave Iowa as her kids were, especially after a decade or so as a single parent and nothing else to do.<br />Two things are immediately evident in the pilot for the show, which was created by Kari Lizer (“The New Adventures of Old Christine”). One, it’s a pandemic production: The airport where Jean says goodbye to her pal Sharon (Sherri Shepherd) is just a facade; every apartment in L.A. seems to be the same set, with the furniture moved around. It’s an underpopulated program, although there’s something heartening, too, about imagining everyone off camera in face masks, distancing and trying to get a show on the air. The other thing that seems apparent is how difficult it will be to sustain sufficient energy with mom in the center ring. All the mothers cited above were sidekicks, or part of an ensemble, but Ms. Sedgwick seems positioned to carry most of the burden, and other than Jean being meddlesome or looking for a sex life—or delivering mawkish soliloquies about the importance of family—there aren’t any obvious avenues to be followed. On the other hand, only the one episode was available for review, so they might fool us all. Let’s hope.<br />There is a potential love interest—Danny (Patrick Brammall) her “host,” in the Airbnb sense, who warns that his dog has a tendency to hump. “So do I,” Jean replies, and Danny, to his credit, looks taken aback. I have to admit I was startled, likewise, when Jean calls a belligerent driver at the airport a “dick.” Much worse can be heard almost everywhere on television, but on a network show? It’s still a little shocking. What would Carol Brady have thought?</td>

      <td>In a week this will end. Let it be.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Donald Trump’s Final Days” (Jan. 8): You write, “If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign.” An impeachment could never be resolved at trial within the remainder of his presidency.<br />You continue, “This would be the cleanest solution since it would immediately turn presidential duties over to Mr. Pence. And it would give Mr. Trump agency, a la Richard Nixon, over his own fate.” Of what high crime or misdemeanor has my president been accused: Of inciting a riot? How exactly? Of somehow failing to speak some magic formula to the mainstream press within a few moments after being informed of a chaotic crisis (which you exaggerate as an “assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election”)? But he hasn’t been shown to have initiated, condoned or sanctioned anything more than a peaceful demonstration. Why then is he supposed to admit culpability in this affair and resign in disgrace?<br />Tactically, it might be beneficial for him to hand the presidency to Vice President Mike Pence and accept a full pardon, a la Nixon. But to do so would destroy a movement that he nurtured and which is far from moribund, for his own personal convenience. Time will vindicate Donald Trump, but this editorial won’t be forgotten in this household long after Mr. Trump leaves office.<br />David deForrest<br />Jacksonville, Fla.</td>

      <td>Stock offering could expand Zoom’s options as it slides into post-pandemic life</td>
      <td>Zoom Video Communications  didn’t exactly call its own peak, but the videoconferencing superstar still has good reasons to cash in on investor enthusiasm.<br />Zoom filed papers Tuesday to sell $1.5 billion worth of common stock, its first offering since going public in April 2019. The shares will be sold by the company, and Zoom included the typical boiler plate explanation in its filing that the proceeds would be used for “working capital and general corporate purposes,” with the possibility that the money also could help fund acquisitions though no current deals are in the works.<br />Zoom’s videoconferencing business is still booming, in large part because of Covid-19, but investors are already grappling with what post-pandemic life could mean for the company. The once-highflying stock is now 40% off its mid-October peak. And while still richly valued at around 30 times forward sales, it is no longer the most premium play among cloud stocks. At least a dozen now carry higher multiples relative to projected sales.<br />But Zoom is still valued at close to $100 billion, a level that software companies don’t typically reach until they have established multiple lines of business. So the company still faces some pressure to show it is no one trick pony.<br />The company disclosed Tuesday that it has now sold 1 million seats for its Zoom Phone service, which replaces office telephone systems. That is a potentially huge market, but also one with very well-entrenched competitors along with newer challengers such as  Microsoft ,  Google and  RingCentral .</td>

      <td>It is unconscionable that Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh may evade justice.</td>
      <td>Gov. Chris Christie is right to raise the alarm over a Pakistani court decision to free one of Daniel Pearl’s convicted murderers (“Extradite Daniel Pearl’s Kidnapper,” Dec. 29). It is unconscionable that Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh may evade justice.<br />We understand the pain of Danny Pearl’s parents. Our daughter Malki, a vivacious American citizen in the 10th grade, was one of 15 murdered in the 2001 Jerusalem Sbarro pizzeria bombing spearheaded by Hamas terrorist Ahlam Tamimi. She confessed to all charges and an Israeli court sentenced her to 16 life terms. After Israel released her in an extortionate prisoner exchange, Tamimi returned to her native Jordan, where she was welcomed as a hero. The U.S. subsequently unveiled federal charges, named her an FBI Most Wanted Terrorist and requested her extradition from Jordan pursuant to a 1995 treaty. Jordan refuses.<br />We stand emphatically with the Pearls and pray public outrage will cause Pakistan to reverse course, ensuring Pearl’s killer remains behind bars or is sent for trial in the U.S. Parents must be spared the agony of manifest injustice on top of heart-breaking personal loss. By the same token, the U.S. should insist Jordan honor the 1995 treaty by extraditing our Malki’s killer to Washington.<br />Frimet and Arnold Roth<br />Jerusalem</td>

The politically correct article concludes by pointing a finger at tenants, investors and regulators.<br />Perhaps there is something wrong with the way architects and advocates for radically improved buildings are making the case.<br />Many politicians are advocating a radical transformation of American infrastructure. With hardly any architects, engineers or scientists in Congress, and in a country with the lowest ratio of engineers to lawyers in the world, what are the chances of radical initiatives or of megaprojects being permitted in the near term? Net zero.<br />If we really want progress, not just social approval, we need to stop preaching to the choir and start listening respectfully to the nonbelievers.<br />Felix DeVito</td>

      <td>Trump administration shifts strategy in effort to speed up pace of administering shots</td>
      <td>The Trump administration is releasing second doses of coronavirus vaccines that were reserved for booster shots and is urging states to give the vaccine to anyone age 65 and older, as well as to people with pre-existing health conditions, a shift in strategy that vastly expands the pool of those eligible for shots while presenting another hurdle for the logistics of administering the vaccine at state and local levels.<br />Starting in two weeks, doses will be allocated based on the pace that states say they are administering the vaccine, as well as the size of a state’s population of people age 65 and older.<br />Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the plan on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Tuesday. “We now believe that our manufacturing is predictable enough that we can ensure second doses are available to people from ongoing production. So everything is now available to our states and our health-care providers,” he said.<br />The government had been allocating about half of newly available doses from  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  to states since the vaccine rollout began last month. Federal officials said there is enough supply to ensure booster shots will be available and that they won’t extend the current recommended dosing schedules.<br />Drug makers expect to be able to produce enough vaccine doses to accommodate the new plans, vaccine manufacturers and supply-chain experts say.</td>
