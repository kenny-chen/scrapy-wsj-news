      <td>Low-wage workers have become a priority for governments around the world as they look to rebuild their economies</td>
      <td>Ireland has added some fresh heat into the question of whether countries should raise minimum wages to put their economies on a more stable footing in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, with Prime Minister Micheál Martin saying his government would look at increasing the level by a fifth.<br />Mr. Martin said such a move would be aimed at addressing income equality exposed by the pandemic, with many lower-income workers across the world bearing the brunt of lockdowns while better-paid people work from home.<br />“I think there is a clear message emanating from Covid that it has exposed the duality of the Irish economy in terms of low-paid workers,” Mr. Martin said during the prime minister’s customary Christmas news conference. “That’s something we’ve got to [consider]—not just a minimum wage, but a living wage, which would really deal to some degree with that issue.”<br />He suggested raising the current minimum wage of 10.10 euros an hour, equivalent to $12.30, to a living wage of €12.30, based on everyday living costs.<br />Some supermarket chains and other private employers in Europe have switched to paying living wages instead of lower minimum wages in recent months to encourage staff retention. But many employers still use minimum wages to set pay rates. A U.K. study conducted by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank, found around half of front-line care workers were paid less than the living wage, as calculated by the Living Wage Foundation.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—A Chinese court imposed a four-year prison term on a citizen journalist who documented how Covid-19 ravaged the city where the coronavirus was first detected, in a case that underscores the lengths to which Beijing has defended its official narrative of the pandemic.<br />Zhang Zhan, 37 years old, was convicted of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” after a roughly 2½-hour trial at the Shanghai Pudong New Area People’s Court on Monday, where prosecutors accused her of spreading falsehoods about the coronavirus pandemic through social-media posts and interviews with overseas media, her lawyers said.<br />The verdict came more than seven months after authorities detained Ms. Zhang in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the pandemic’s original epicenter, where she posted more than 120 YouTube videos chronicling conditions in the city and detailed what she saw as missteps in the government’s initial pandemic response.<br />Her detention dovetails with Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s campaign to recast the coronavirus pandemic in China as a showcase of the Communist Party’s good governance, featuring extensive propaganda and censorship efforts aimed at mollifying public anger and suppressing criticism against missteps in the government’s initial response.<br />The case against Ms. Zhang is the first known prosecution of a citizen journalist who covered the coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan, where government efforts to punish whistleblowers and suppress information on the early outbreak stirred a public backlash and prompted some ordinary citizens to chronicle conditions in Wuhan with firsthand accounts over social media. At least three other citizen journalists in Wuhan disappeared in February and, though one of them briefly resurfaced in April, their fate remains unclear, rights activists say.</td>

      <td>VATICAN CITY—Pope Francis has stepped up long-planned overhauls to the Vatican’s finances, after pressure from the pandemic and financial scandals that have battered the Catholic Church’s reputation.<br />The changes are relatively modest and come more than seven years after Pope Francis was elected with a mandate to reform the Vatican’s finances, following a series of scandals over alleged corruption and incompetence under his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.<br />The pope this year centralized the management of investments previously handled by officials in different offices and made new rules on procurement to save money and prevent corruption. The Vatican has also become more forthcoming about its use of donations.<br />“The economic situation and the scandals have accelerated the process of reform and forced the Vatican to take measures it should have taken years ago,” said Sandro Magister, a Vatican expert who writes for Italy’s L’Espresso magazine.<br />The Vatican continues to grapple with a scandal over a costly investment in London real estate, which erupted in October 2019 with an extraordinary raid by Vatican police of the Secretariat of State, the Holy See’s executive arm. The Holy See refers to the Catholic Church’s central administration in Rome and the papal diplomatic network around the world. It is separate from Vatican City, the sovereign territory in Italy ruled by the pope.</td>

He asked the French government for help getting out of it and later enlisted a  Rothschild  & Co. banker to conduct back-channel talks with Tiffany, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Arnault, upset over Tiffany’s insistence on paying full shareholder dividends before the deal closed, demanded the jeweler lower the deal price by 11%, the people said.<br />Tiffany declined and pressed ahead with a lawsuit, filed in a Delaware court, to enforce the initial merger agreement.<br />In the end, LVMH agreed to buy Tiffany at a 2.6% discount from the original deal price. Tiffany made a $70 million dividend payment last week.</td>

      <td>A Chinese asset market that barely existed three decades ago is now one of the world’s largest and most important centres of leverage and economic activity.<br />The country’s property sector has developed at a breakneck pace, construction and asset prices have surged, and the country’s top real-estate developers have become some of the largest firms in the world.<br />Real-estate investment has outstripped GDP growth for the most of the last two decades, excluding brief periods of financial stress in 2008-09, 2015-16 and the first quarter of 2020, figures from China’s National Bureau of Statistics show. With negligible foreign investment, that means debt has mounted both at developers and the families buying the properties.<br />As recently as 1978, virtually no housing was privately owned in China. Creeping experimental reforms led to the beginning of wholesale privatization of the public housing stock in 1988. In the early and mid-1990s, the real-estate giants of today—and their future billionaire owners—were just coming into existence.<br />In December 1987, Shenzhen held its first auction of land use rights, a practice mimicking the sales conducted a few miles south in Hong Kong, still under British control at the time. The model would eventually be adopted by municipalities across the country and become a major source of funding for cash-strapped local governments.</td>

      <td>No longer China’s most valuable company,  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  has erased almost all its stock-market gains this year, just days after Chinese regulators signaled a major change in their posture toward the e-commerce behemoth and its finance affiliate, Ant Group Co.<br />Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares tumbled a further 8% on Monday, after China’s central bank released a harshly worded statement Sunday criticizing Ant’s business practices and instructing the financial-technology giant to shift its focus back to its mainstay—and less lucrative—digital-payments business.<br />The declines extended a stock selloff on Christmas Eve, taking Alibaba’s market capitalization down to $586 billion. Just two months earlier, it had hit a record of nearly $859 billion on expectations that Alibaba would profit handsomely from Ant’s public listing.<br />Alibaba’s swift comedown has led investors to reassess the regulatory risks faced by Chinese internet companies. Last Thursday, the country’s top commerce regulator said it is investigating whether Alibaba abused its dominant market position in online retailing through activities such as making merchants sell products exclusively on its platforms.<br />The hard part is figuring out “how much of the recent regulatory moves against Ant and Alibaba is politically based, how far it will go, and when it will be over,” said Alex Au, managing director at Alphalex Capital Management, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund. He said he is considering buying Alibaba shares if they fall further.</td>

      <td>A tumultuous year in oil markets left the energy industry reeling and gave fresh impetus to a perennial debate: What is the best gauge of crude prices?<br />The Covid-19 pandemic confined billions of people to their homes and shut or slowed portions of the global economy in 2020, crimping demand for oil. Depots, pipelines and vessels were flooded with crude, threatening to overwhelm the world’s ability to store it.<br />The crisis reached its crescendo in April, when the price of light, sweet U.S. crude futures dived below $0 a barrel for the first time. Some traders were paying others to take oil off their hands.<br />“What we saw was the single largest demand event in history,” said Peter Keavey, managing director for energy products at  CME  Group, owner of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where U.S. crude futures trade.<br />Prices have since somewhat recovered. But those jarring moves of the spring added urgency to arguments about whether benchmarks used since the 1980s adequately reflect the modern oil market. Newer gauges, including Shanghai-traded futures and a contract for Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude that will make its debut in March, are expected to grow in popularity.</td>

      <td>The SolarWinds hack has boosted shares of the former cybersecurity star, but the benefits aren’t so clear-cut</td>
      <td>Going from predator to prey back to predator again has been a profitable ride for  FireEye  investors. How it works out for the company itself remains to be seen.<br />High-profile network breaches have often been a boon for cybersecurity stocks, and the massive  SolarWinds  hack has been no exception. The NYSE FactSet Global Cyber Security Index has jumped 13% since the attack was reported on Dec. 13. The 12 largest pure-play vendors on that index are now up an average 20% in that time.<br />The attack used a flaw in the network-management software sold by SolarWinds, a Texas-based IT company that counts many federal agencies as customers. But ironically, it was brought to light by FireEye, which specializes in hack investigations and was itself a victim of the attack.<br />It has been a wild ride. FireEye’s shares sank 13% after it reported the breach of its own system on Dec. 8. That seemed like very bad news for a company that is often the first call for other companies who suffer an attack. Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard warned at the time that FireEye faced a clear risk of “reputational damage,” even as the company described the attack as the work of “a highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.”<br />But since more news has dribbled out about the scale of the attack and SolarWinds’ centrality to it, sentiment shifted hard. FireEye’s shares have soared 66% from their initial selloff and are now up 49% this month—beating out even other red-hot cybersecurity names such as  CrowdStrike  and  Zscaler  that analysts believe will be the primary beneficiaries of increased corporate IT security spending. Those two are up 44% and 32% for the month, respectively, and more than 300% for the year. SolarWinds, by contrast, has lost one-third of its market value since the attack became public.</td>

      <td>LONDON—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ended a rocky year on a high note, with a free-trade agreement with the European Union under his belt and mass vaccination against Covid-19 under way.<br />Now that the country is unconstrained by most EU rules, he has a once-in-a-generation political opportunity to reshape the U.K. and define its post-EU direction. The big unknown is what he will do with that opportunity.<br />Brexit was billed by some of its longtime advocates as a way of unleashing a new dynamism in Britain by ditching Brussels’ red tape to create a low-tax, freewheeling “Singapore-on-Thames”—a phrase coined by a previous British Treasury chief, Philip Hammond—selling its goods and services across the world.<br />But Mr. Johnson isn’t a free-market Conservative in the mold of Margaret Thatcher. He has so far promised Britons more regulation, not less, with ambitious plans to raise the minimum wage and curb greenhouse-gas emissions. He has promised more state spending, not less, in order to “level up” an economy he says is too dependent on London and southern England.<br />Such policies enabled him to win big in last year’s election in districts traditionally hostile to the ruling Conservatives, while his dogged pursuit of Brexit alienated many of his party’s traditional allies in corporate boardrooms. All these tensions present a puzzle: If Mr. Johnson doesn’t want another Thatcher-style economic revolution, what does he want to do with Britain’s freedom from Brussels?</td>

      <td>Grocery-delivery service Instacart Inc. once seemed like the perfect partner for supermarkets looking to break into e-commerce. After several years together, though, some grocers are starting to question the relationship.<br />Instacart’s technology provided a ready-made solution for grocery chains that hadn’t yet created options for customers to shop online. And it became even more attractive when delivery demand ballooned with the pandemic, providing armies of on-demand shoppers to fulfill orders in-store and deliver groceries to people’s homes.<br />But many supermarkets say they aren’t making money through Instacart, largely because the delivery company typically charges them a commission of more than 10% of each order. Some of Instacart’s retailer partners say the service holds too much control over customer interactions and expect it to take an increasing share of money that food makers spend on marketing. All that has put grocers in a bind, as delivery continues to boom and becomes a necessity.<br />“We don’t think we make money from an Instacart order,” said Mark Skogen, CEO of Skogen’s Foodliner Inc., which operates more than 30 stores under its Festival Foods brand and began offering Instacart about a year ago.<br />Delivery remains costly because his company pays Instacart a percentage of its online sales, Mr. Skogen said. The grocer still works with Instacart because it allows for higher revenue even if there is no profit.</td>

      <td>Ant’s troubles may be particularly severe, but others should be watching their backs</td>
      <td>China’s latest salvo against one of its most well-known technology giants could portend a more perilous regulatory regime for others in the industry as well.<br />China’s central bank Sunday publicly criticized Ant Group, which owns one of the country’s two dominant digital-payment systems, for multiple regulatory failings and urged the company to rectify problems in some of its fastest-growing areas such as online lending. Ant was accused of engaging in regulatory arbitrage, showing contempt for regulatory compliance, and damaging consumers’ rights. On Thursday, China’s market regulator said it had launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba, which owns a third of Ant.<br />The writing has been on the wall for Ant ever since regulators forced the company to put a last-minute stop to its combined $34 billion of initial public offerings in Hong Kong and Shanghai last month. Ant will likely have to scale back some of its higher-margin, faster-growing businesses, such as online lending. The company has previously acted as an online platform for these loans without taking on much of the risk—an asset-light model that made investors give it a valuation above $300 billion before its IPOs ran aground, but was also likely a factor irking regulators. Ant may now have to put up more of its own capital and be regulated more like a bank.<br />Beijing’s one-two punch against the business empire of Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder of Alibaba, clearly reflects his dwindling political fortunes, but it may also point to a shift in the regulatory environment for other technology companies. Many of the problems highlighted by regulators were well-known. Alibaba’s rivals, for example, have long complained about the company’s practice of forcing merchants to sell exclusively on its platforms, though Beijing hasn’t taken much concrete action to tackle this until now. The government last month issued draft rules against monopolistic practices on digital platforms.<br />Chinese technology giants have become so big partly because the government has imposed relatively few constraints on their growth. Tighter regulations could be good news if Beijing is going to lay out clear boundaries and rules, helping create a level playing field. But if it means more arbitrary regulatory actions related to political, rather than market missteps, that could be a nightmare for Chinese technology giants—and their investors.</td>

      <td>Shirley Young, a Chinese immigrant who served as a vice president of General Motors and helped the auto maker set up a manufacturing joint venture in China in the late 1990s, died Saturday at a hospital in Manhattan. She was 85 and had breast cancer.<br />The daughter of a Chinese diplomat executed in Manila during World War II, Ms. Young arrived in the U.S. when she was 10 years old and worked in market research before joining GM in 1988.<br />Ms. Young was a founder and former chair of the Committee of 100, which advocates for Chinese Americans and seeks to improve Sino-U.S. relations. She also was a director of companies including  Bank of America Corp.  and  Salesforce.com Inc.  and vice chairman of the nominating committee of the New York Stock Exchange. In her business career, she was often the only woman and Asian in the room when decisions were being made.<br />A friend of the Chinese pianist Lang Lang and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, she promoted artistic exchanges between China and the U.S.<br />In recent years, amid deteriorating relations between Beijing and Washington, she called for reconciliation and greater understanding. “We have to work together,” she told the Xinhua News Agency in 2018. “Given the intertwined relationship and globalization, it’s ridiculous to think we cannot work together.”</td>

      <td>Four years ago, when pregnant with twins, Kristin Rising unsuccessfully begged her parents to move close by to help. When they came for a visit this summer, she didn’t have to say a word.<br />“I was really at a low, exhausted, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to do this’ state,” says Dr. Rising, an emergency medicine physician and researcher whose Philadelphia day care closed during the pandemic. “I honestly think my mom just took a look at me when she got there and said, ‘Oh my God. We need to move here. My daughter is going to be crushed by this.’ ”<br />Overwhelmed by precarious school and child-care arrangements, working parents are turning to their own mothers and fathers for relief like never before. Grandparents are often transforming their lives to help.<br />The pandemic has washed away the informal, fluid arrangements that once came with being an involved grandparent—flying in for spring break if you lived far away, picking up a sick kid from school if you were local.<br />Instead, grandparents concerned about the risks of Covid-19 are often forced to make a choice: Isolate from the younger generation entirely, or dive in, becoming full-time caregivers bubbled with extended family. Many are choosing the latter, moving to new cities or pausing or ending work in its twilight to help their children maintain careers—or just a semblance of sanity.</td>

Republicans had solid control of the state Senate and, until a wave of elections that followed the Watergate scandal, the state Assembly.<br />That climate forged the governing style of Joe Lentol and Robin Schimminger, who after a combined 92 years in office are leaving their Assembly seats at the end of the year. Mr. Lentol lost a Democratic primary in June; Mr. Schimminger, who is also a Democrat, didn’t seek another term.<br />In recent interviews, the men said the lessons from their early years in the chamber—which has been controlled by Democrats since 1975—are instructive in a current political climate that they called divisive.<br />“It isn’t all speaking truth to power and saying what you want,” said Mr. Lentol, who was first elected to represent north Brooklyn in 1972. “You have to learn—and some never learn—that politics is the art of compromise. Fortunately, I learned that as a minority member of the house, and it’s probably a worthwhile experience for anybody who’s a Democrat today.”<br />Mr. Schimminger was first elected in 1976 in a district that includes north Buffalo. He has voted against expansions of abortion rights, and during his time in office, he regularly ran with the support of the Conservative Party.</td>

No one else was seen coming or going from the RV that exploded in security footage.<br />Douglas Korneski, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Memphis field office, said investigators haven’t identified Mr. Warner’s motive and asked anyone who knew him to come forward. “Right now we’re looking at any and all possible motives,” Mr. Korneski said.</td>

      <td>Ordained in Rangoon, he urged his Buddhist co-religionists to despise British colonialism. His Dublin origins may have added to the fervor.</td>
      <td>The endearingly earnest authors of “The Irish Buddhist” describe their book as “a detective story across two centuries.” Although their sleuthing is mostly archival, the tale they assemble is captivating—a jigsaw-biography that pieces together the life of Dhammaloka, a “forgotten monk” who, we’re told, “faced down the British Empire.”<br />This last assertion may seem overstated—the British Empire was, after all, a vast and impregnable place in the first decade of the 20th century, when Dhammaloka was at his militant peak. Yet the monk, born in the Dublin area in the 1850s, did succeed in making an almighty nuisance of himself in Burma, a Buddhist colonial backwater that was then a province of British India. So much so that he was charged with sedition, the cardinal colonial sin.<br />Dhammaloka arrived in Burma as William Colvin—almost certainly not his real name—sometime before 1900, traveling from Australia (it is thought) via Ceylon and India. Already steeped in Buddhist learning, he was ordained as a monk in Rangoon in July of that year. The event was “no simple and quiet affair,” the book tells us, but a lavish ceremony funded by a local merchant. Gathered to see the “auspicious ordination of a European into the Buddhist order” were more than 100 monks and 200 laypersons. The officiant was a “particularly prominent” Burmese monk and scholar.<br />It’s likely that Dhammaloka regarded this treatment as entirely befitting. As the book’s authors—Alicia Turner, Laurence Cox and Brian Bocking, all professors of religious studies—write, the Irish Buddhist cut a “bombastic” public figure. The monastic name he chose for himself can mean both“realm of the law” and “light of the law” in Pali, the sacred language of the Theravada Buddhism practiced in Burma.<br />Once ordained, Dhammaloka embarked on a 10-year spree of deliberate confrontation with the British colonial authorities, mainly in Burma but also in Ceylon, Malaya, Hong Kong and Singapore. The authors tell us that the stock-in-trade of this “disruptive, border-hopping monk” was the “Buddhist revivalist” sermon, by which he addressed crowds of Burmese natives on the evils of Christianity. A stern advocate of temperance, he inveighed against alcohol; he also spoke out against the British military presence in Burma and elsewhere. His “three-part critique” of colonialism, the authors observe, centered on “the Bible, the bottle, and the Gatling gun.”</td>

      <td>Cleveland was missing four wide receivers in a 23-16 defeat against New York that could cost the team a playoff spot</td>
      <td>Early Sunday morning, the Cleveland Browns found themselves conducting a makeshift practice in a parking garage. They went over plays, assessed their roster and figured out how to play an NFL game just hours later without almost all of their top receivers had been sidelined by contact tracing.<br />Spending their morning in a frigid New Jersey garage was slightly less grim than how they spent their afternoon. They lost to the New York Jets.<br />The 23-16 loss could cost the Browns a spot in the playoffs, and it was the latest demonstration of how the virus that has upended a country and its most popular sport isn’t stopping as the season hits the home stretch.<br />The Browns were in this predicament after a player received a positive Covid-19 test result Saturday. Their facility was closed, their flight from Cleveland later in the day was delayed and a host of players were forced into league-mandated isolation as close contacts. Those players happened to include their most productive wide receivers, so they held the quick walk-through at the garage next to their hotel Sunday to come up with a game plan when they were missing the likes of Jarvis Landry.<br />It was clear throughout the game that Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield missed his usual weapons. He completed just 28 of 53 passes and lost two fumbles, including one late in the fourth quarter that ended the game. It was a crushing outcome for a franchise that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2002 and appeared on a path to break that drought. Then they lost to one of the NFL’s worst teams—the Jets hadn’t won a single game until last week after losing their first 13 games.</td>

One of the stars is former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm to lead the Department of Energy, and the choice suggests a return to climate corporate subsidies.<br />DOE’s main duties are to oversee nuclear sites, set efficiency standards and dole out government largesse. But her credential for Mr. Biden may be that, during her governorship from 2003 to 2011, Ms. Granholm handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to politically favored startups to create “green jobs.” Many of her bets failed.<br />Take fledgling electric-car battery manufacturer A123 Systems, which was awarded a $249 million DOE grant plus $125 million in state tax credits. Plagued by manufacturing problems, A123 went bankrupt in 2012. China’s Wanxiang Group bought most of its assets.<br />A123’s customer, Fisker Automotive, also went bust in 2013 after receiving a $192 million DOE loan with the goal of manufacturing a hybrid at a plant located in Mr. Biden’s senatorial backyard. Fisker was backed by prominent liberal investors including Al Gore. “Lobbying by all local politicians is said to have won the day for the Wilmington plant,” the Washington Post reported in 2013.<br />Ms. Granholm also offered battery manufacturer  LG Chem  $125 million on top of the $150 million in federal stimulus dollars it received. While LG Chem is still in business, its employees at the time were caught watching movies and playing games on the clock because they ostensibly had little productive to do.</td>

      <td>The FDA also eases its vigilance over cherry pie standards.</td>
      <td>Unknown to most Americans, the Food and Drug Administration has for decades regulated the ingredients, composition, flavor and appearance of many foods. In a small victory for consumer choice and food innovation, the FDA this month proposed liberating French dressing and frozen cherry pie.<br />The 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the FDA to regulate the “standards of identity” of hundreds of food products to ensure uniform labelling. Ever wonder why some foods taste and look the same regardless of the brand? Credit the FDA.<br />The FDA requires ketchup to have a pH of 4.2±0.2 and lemon juice “may be used in quantities no greater than necessary to adjust the pH.” The consistency must also be such “that its flow is not more than 14 centimeters in 30 seconds at 20 °C.” Manufacturers have more leeway with hummus, aioli and pickle relish.<br />The FDA standards of identity have grown to occupy thousands of pages in the Federal Register and now serve mainly to fatten trial lawyers who can sue manufacturers if their labels don’t conform to government specifications. This is why some low-fat ice creams are labeled frozen dairy desserts.<br />Since 1950 the FDA has required that French salad dressing be made of oil, “acidifying ingredients” such as vinegar or lemon juice with vegetable oil constituting 35% by weight, though it need not include tomato paste. The FDA is especially vigilant on the threat from frozen cherry pie.</td>

      <td>Donald Trump ran for President on wiping out the Islamic State and stopping China’s economic predations. Edward Snowden’s illegal disclosures weakened America’s defenses against foreign terrorists and boosted Beijing’s cyber-espionage against the U.S.<br />So why are there murmurs that the President is considering a pardon for the unrepentant former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, who stole over a million American national-security documents and absconded to Hong Kong and then Moscow?<br />In office Mr. Trump was stung repeatedly by grandiose government leakers who thought they stood above the democratic process. That description also fits Mr. Snowden, who never formally registered complaints about U.S. intelligence policies while contracting for the government, but has since made himself a celebrity with claims of moral righteousness.<br />But Mr. Trump seems to be in a mood to break things as his term comes to a close, and Mr. Snowden’s defenders have sought to appeal to the President’s suspicion of the U.S. intelligence agencies to entice him toward a midnight pardon. The likes of Roger Stone and Senator Rand Paul suggest that Mr. Snowden is a useful figure in Mr. Trump’s campaign against the intelligence establishment.<br />It would be a travesty if the President fell for this. The victims of Snowden-style treachery are ordinary Americans, not Mr. Trump’s “deep state” foes. A pardon for Mr. Snowden’s behavior would invite more of it.</td>

      <td>The president-elect longs for ‘normal,’ but inherits an EU courting China and pushing out the U.S.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is committed to restoring normal service in U.S. relations with Europe, but the truth is there is no “normal” left. The European Commission talks of a “new trans-Atlantic agenda for global change,” but the European Union is also rushing to complete a trade deal with China. The incoming administration finds itself at odds with the EU over trade and investment. The Biden crowd should ponder one of President Obama’s favorite lines, “The world is what it is,” and respond with as much realism and as little idealism as possible.<br />Trans-Atlantic relations may improve in tone, but their content has changed and was changing long before Donald Trump entered the White House. The Cold War ended three decades ago. The fruits of that American-led victory include a liberal, democratic and peaceful Europe. The worm in the apple is that the Europeans can act independently, whether as individual nations or in concert through the EU. The more independent they are, the less they want advice from Americans.<br />The post-Cold War divergence of American and European interests is usually attributed to the George W. Bush administration’s response to 9/11: the bungled interventions that set off a human wave of migrants and terrorism in Europe; the hostile behavior of the Department of Homeland Security, which remains a powerful disincentive to visiting the U.S. All true, but deeper processes were already at work.<br />The full quotation, from V.S. Naipaul, is: “The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.” In 1945, most of Europe was nothing but rubble. By 1990 Western Europe had remade itself under American supervision and protection. The EU has since expanded to 27 states and sought to secure a place as an independent node in a multipolar world.<br />Strategic competition with the U.S. is a natural part of that effort. As Sweden’s then-Prime Minister Goran Persson said in June 2001, the EU is “one of the few institutions we can develop as a balance to U.S. world domination.”</td>

      <td>January will be tough but with sensible precautions the virus can be a manageable risk by spring.</td>
      <td>The novel coronavirus is about to make its last major stand, so prepare for the most difficult six weeks yet. But things will look up as spring approaches. Stay safe and try to avoid being the last person to get sick from Covid-19.<br />Next year will still require caution, but fear of Covid won’t dominate life after the winter recedes. Prevalence will decline sharply in the spring and summer. The virus may re-emerge in the fall, but it can be a manageable threat with the right precautions.<br />That said, relegating the pandemic to 2020 will require some changes. The virus is likely to become endemic, meaning it will continue to circulate but at a much lower level than the epidemic. If we are prudent, next fall could look like an especially virulent flu season in which the vaccines are a poor match. Most of the activities Americans enjoy will resume, though some of them will require precautions.<br />That starts with changes in the way people go to work. It should be frowned upon to come to work sick and try to “brave out” a cold. Testing for flu and Covid will be widespread with home tests. Many people may still prefer to wear masks in public venues, but they won’t be required. We will be more mindful of ventilation indoors and crowds in confined spaces.<br />These steps will have benefits that go beyond Covid. They’ll also slow the spread of other respiratory infections—including influenza, which exacts a huge toll each year. The flu caused more than 40 million symptomatic illnesses and 650,000 hospitalizations in the 2018-19 season, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A 2018 study in the journal Vaccine estimates the economic damage, including reduced productivity, at $11.2 billion a year. That figure may be conservative; some models say the burden is up to $87 billion annually.</td>

      <td>The federal government sues the chain for filling valid prescriptions in compliance with state law.</td>
      <td>Alcohol sales to adults are legal in all 50 states, and some substantial percentage of legally purchased alcohol is consumed by alcoholics, to their and society’s detriment. Imagine a federal lawsuit against a grocery chain for selling beer to adults without protecting alcoholics from buying it. Such a case would be groundless: No federal law limits beer sales to adults in this way.<br />The Justice Department last week announced a similarly groundless civil suit against  Walmart .  The complaint alleges that the chain’s 5,000-plus pharmacies fueled the opioid crisis by “unlawfully” filling prescriptions.<br />Like the hypothetical beer case, this case against Walmart mocks the rule of law. State laws require pharmacists to fill prescriptions that have been validly written by qualified medical practitioners. Pharmacists lack the expertise to second-guess doctors’ judgments about the appropriate necessity of a medication and the proper dosing for a particular patient. To write a prescription for a controlled substance—which includes all opioids—a physician must be qualified by the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Walmart complies with that federal rule.<br />When Walmart pharmacists have hesitated to fill legally written opioid prescriptions, they have often been subjected to state sanctions. The president of the Texas Medical Board threatened to issue “cease and desist orders” against pharmacists who “change amounts of opioids prescribed” or “override” a physician’s judgment, on grounds that doing so constitutes practicing medicine without a license. Wisconsin’s Board of Pharmacy threatened disciplinary action against a Walmart pharmacy because it “informed a local clinic that the Pharmacy would no longer fill controlled substance prescriptions from that clinic due to concerns of overprescribing.” Complaints against Walmart and its pharmacists for refusing to fill opioid prescriptions have been filed with or pursued by pharmacy boards in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia.<br />Under the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, when there’s a contradiction between valid federal and state law, the former prevails. But there’s no federal law requiring that Walmart pharmacists refuse to fill prescriptions that state law requires them to fill. The Controlled Substances Act creates only two circumstances in which pharmacists commit a federal crime by filling facially valid prescriptions for controlled substances.</td>

Follow me on a magical musical tour down one last rabbit hole before the lockdown looney tunes end. Music will set you free.<br />You’ve probably seen zillions of concert movies, from “Woodstock” and “The Song Remains the Same” to “American Utopia.” But I think a choice list of movies can lead us all the way to the essence of the 1960s-to-’80s music scene. Forget reading a book; that’s like swimming a marathon—we’ve got to see and hear the story.<br />Maybe we warm up with the daddy-issues biopics “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Rocketman.” Or the raunchy “The Dirt” about Mötley Crüe, who just have issues period. Or “Sid and Nancy.” But forget fiction. Let’s hear from real musicians. Don’t stop me now.<br />We’re ready for “Echo in the Canyon” about the music scene in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles—lots on Roger McGuinn and David Crosby of the Byrds (the Beatles’ favorite American band, it turns out). Their unique sound came from Rickenbacker guitars made in nearby Santa Ana. John Lennon played a Rickenbacker, and when someone from the company invited the band to a New York hotel to see the second-ever-made electric 12-string guitar, George Harrison grabbed it and changed pop music forever. Americans supplied the weapons Eric Clapton and other Brits used in the Invasion. We’ll learn the beginnings of the Beach Boys, mixing in The Mamas and The Papas, plus Stephen Stills and Neil Young of Buffalo Springfield. Is this that essence we’re searching for? Maybe, but it certainly reveals the origin of decades of American music.<br />The narrator of “Echo” is Jakob Dylan, Bob’s son. So next watch Martin Scorsese’s “Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story.” It’s about the 1975-76 ragtag bus tour of Dylan and a collection of musicians—there’s Joni Mitchell, and hangers-on like Allen Ginsberg. Be warned, there are a lot of fake Easter eggs in the documentary, including actress Sharon Stone in a Kiss T-shirt joining the tour.</td>

      <td>The five U.S. citizens and one permanent resident are pawns in a power struggle.</td>
      <td>Six Venezuelan-born Citgo executives were living and working in the U.S. in mid-November 2017 when they were summoned by Citgo parent PdVSA—the Venezuelan state-owned oil monopoly—to Caracas for a meeting.<br />The five naturalized U.S. citizens and one U.S. permanent resident were in good standing with the Houston-based firm. As they boarded the corporate jet, they couldn’t have known that they were headed for prison.<br />As the team convened in a PdVSA boardroom on Nov. 21, 2017, Venezuelan military intelligence swooped in to arrest them. They were charged with embezzlement, though the debt deal they supposedly cooked up to benefit themselves never happened. Last month, after a closed-door trial, they were declared guilty. Their sentences range from eight to 13 years. Appeals are expected.<br />Whether the six overstepped their authority at Citgo isn’t clear. But there is no doubt they were denied due process in Venezuela and are pawns in a wider power struggle. On one side of the chess board is strongman Nicolás Maduro. On the other is former Oil Minister and former PdVSA president Rafael Ramírez, now wanted on graft charges. In July Venezuela requested Mr. Ramírez’s extradition from Italy, though according to press reports his whereabouts are unknown.<br />Meanwhile, discrediting the apparatus he built during 12 years at the helm of Venezuelan oil policy is a Maduro priority, which likely explains the hauling in of the Citgo Six. Since the men were also working for a U.S.-based company now controlled by Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó—recognized by more than 50 democracies as the country’s rightful president—their arrest is also a way for Mr. Maduro to show he can still influence Citgo’s fate.</td>

      <td>A sustained effort is under way to deny children access to literature. Under the slogan #DisruptTexts, critical-theory ideologues, schoolteachers and  Twitter  agitators are purging and propagandizing against classic texts—everything from Homer to F. Scott Fitzgerald to Dr. Seuss.<br />Their ethos holds that children shouldn’t have to read stories written in anything other than the present-day vernacular—especially those “in which racism, sexism, ableism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hate are the norm,” as young-adult novelist Padma Venkatraman writes in School Library Journal. No author is valuable enough to spare, Ms. Venkatraman instructs: “Absolving Shakespeare of responsibility by mentioning that he lived at a time when hate-ridden sentiments prevailed, risks sending a subliminal message that academic excellence outweighs hateful rhetoric.”<br />The subtle complexities of literature are being reduced to the crude clanking of “intersectional” power struggles. Thus Seattle English teacher Evin Shinn tweeted in 2018 that he’d “rather die” than teach “The Scarlet Letter,” unless Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel is used to “fight against misogyny and slut-shaming.”<br />Outsiders got a glimpse of the intensity of the #DisruptTexts campaign recently when self-described “antiracist teacher” Lorena Germán complained that many classics were written more than 70 years ago: “Think of US society before then & the values that shaped this nation afterwards. THAT is what is in those books.”<br />Jessica Cluess, an author of young-adult fiction, shot back: “If you think Hawthorne was on the side of the judgmental Puritans . . . then you are an absolute idiot and should not have the title of educator in your twitter bio.”</td>

      <td>A Labor Department ruling determined that before becoming head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Steve Dickson participated in efforts by  Delta Air Lines Inc.  management to wrongly use a psychiatric evaluation to retaliate against a pilot who raised safety concerns.<br />The lengthy decision by a department administrative law judge concluded that Mr. Dickson, as Delta’s senior vice president of flight operations, knew about and approved punitive moves against veteran co-pilot Karlene Petitt, who was deemed unfit to fly in December 2016 after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The diagnosis eventually was reversed and she resumed flying.<br />The ruling supported Ms. Petitt’s claims that she was singled out for special scrutiny to try to keep her quiet about safety issues. Scott Morris, the judge who presided over the long-running litigation, determined that Delta punished and discriminated against a federally protected whistleblower without any evidence indicating her “performance as a pilot was deficient in any way.” According to the decision, “not a single witness questioned her flying acumen.”<br />The ruling says that “in this case, the squeaky wheel did not get the grease.” Instead, “it got unlawfully discriminated against in the form of a career defining” mental-health evaluation. Ms. Petitt has four decades of flying experience and a doctorate in aviation safety. Many inside Delta saw her safety concerns and warnings as valid and told her to brief managers about them, according to the decision, but simultaneously other company officials identified her as a candidate for psychiatric evaluation.<br />Issued before Christmas, the ruling contains strong criticism of Delta’s safety culture and more broadly warns against management’s use of compulsory psychological assessments “for the purposes of obtaining blind compliance by its pilots.”</td>

Fiscally constrained, we took in the occasional boarder. Rick Ames was one. We soon recognized him as a seldom-bathed alcoholic and searched for an excuse to kick him out.<br />One night in 1962 we found it—and then some. Rick severed an artery by jabbing his forearm through one of the house’s glass windows. A serpentine trail led me and a friend to a pool of blood.<br />Equally intense emotions of disgust and sympathy pulled me in opposite directions, but my Boy Scout training took over. I squeezed a pressure point to stop the bleeding and tourniqueted Rick’s arm, noting the time in huge magic-marker letters on his forehead.<br />Rick was wrapped in plastic garbage bags, carried over the rugs of the foyer and driven to the emergency room in some reluctant brother’s automobile. The next day our boarder’s bags were gone, his key was returned and he was forgotten.<br />It turns out Rick’s father was a CIA agent who eventually got Rick into the agency. From there Aldrich “Rick” Ames became the most notorious mole in CIA history, betraying at least 12 of America’s best secret agents in the Soviet bloc. Many of them were executed. Alas, I was a few pints of blood away from saving these fellows, but my Boy Scout training doomed them. The tourniquet works.</td>

      <td>The Bills host their first home playoff game in a quarter-century, but fans will likely be kept out.</td>
      <td>The Buffalo Bills have won the AFC East division for the first time in 25 years and secured their first home playoff game in almost as long. Thousands of jubilant Bills fans waited hours in the cold to greet the team, which arrived at the Buffalo airport at 1:30 a.m. after beating the Denver Broncos on Dec. 19 to clinch the division title. The die-hards were restless after being barred from Bills games all season. Whether Bills Stadium will join the 13 others that allow in fans before the playoffs may now depend on the wisdom of Howard Zucker—the state health commissioner, who signed off on New York’s now-infamous March 25 directive barring nursing homes from turning away Covid-positive residents.<br />I grew up in Buffalo in the 1970s and ’80s, lean times for Bills fans. When I left for college in 1990, the team promptly made it to the Super Bowl, but lost when Scott Norwood’s last-minute field-goal attempt drifted wide right. The Bills returned to the Super Bowl during my sophomore, junior and senior years but lost each time. In 1995, when I was 23, the Bills won the division but lost to Pittsburgh in the second playoff round. Little did I know I’d be 48 before when my team won the AFC East again.<br />Suffering is an integral part of being a Buffalo sports fan and so is loyalty. Possibly excepting the Green Bay Packers, I can’t think of a team more closely intertwined with its city’s identity and fortune than the Bills. In an otherwise hellish year, the team and its faithful—affectionately known as the “Bills Mafia”—finally have a reason to be hopeful and proud.<br />The coal in our Bills stockings is the absence of fans in the stadium. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has sent mixed signals about opening up Bills Stadium all season. On Sept. 30, he said he’d tour the stadium and meet with team leadership to “talk through” the issues around reopening. By Nov. 6, he backtracked and said that Dr. Zucker—whose nursing-home order led to the deaths of at least 6,200 people—had told him it would be “reckless” to allow any fans back into the (outdoor) stadium, which has a capacity of more than 71,000.<br />The governor never came to tour the stadium, but he recently said he’d “love nothing more” than to attend a Bills home playoff game. He insisted that Dr. Zucker’s Department of Health needs to green-light any deal to open up the stadium, including a cautious proposal to admit about 6,700 fans.</td>

It said the company “despised” complying with regulations and engaged in regulatory arbitrage, without providing specifics.<br />The statement from the People’s Bank of China followed a Saturday meeting between the central bank, representatives of Ant, and China’s securities, banking and foreign-exchange regulators. It was presented as a Q&A with the PBOC’s vice governor Pan Gongsheng.<br />The public rebuke came less than two months after Beijing pulled the plug on Ant’s planned initial public offerings in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Nov. 3. The blockbuster IPO had been set to raise at least $34 billion—valuing Ant at more than $300 billion—but Chinese President Xi Jinping personally decided to halt the deal after Mr. Ma infuriated government leaders with a speech in which he criticized financial regulation, The Wall Street Journal has reported.<br />Ant said it appreciated the guidance and would comply with the regulatory requirements.

      <td>Doses of monoclonal antibodies—Covid-19 therapies authorized for emergency use last month—are sitting unused in hospital pharmacies, even as cases surge across the country.<br />Hospitals say the rollout of the therapies has been stunted by a lukewarm response from infectious-disease specialists, who say they want more clinical trial data before using them on a regular basis. Medical centers are also grappling with a lack of awareness and interest from both the primary-care doctors who would normally prescribe the drug and patients who are offered it. And some places are dealing with a shortage of space and staff to administer the therapies.<br />When monoclonal antibody therapies from  Eli Lilly  & Co. and  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.  were approved for emergency use in November, health agencies were worried there wouldn’t be enough supply to meet demand. Now, health-care providers are administering just 20% of the doses they receive each week, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, the federal initiative to support development of new drugs, vaccines and diagnostics for Covid-19.<br />Monoclonal antibodies, which are also used to treat other diseases, work by taking a page from the body’s own natural antibody defenses, targeting specific spots on intruding pathogens. Eli Lilly’s bamlanivimab and Regeneron’s casirivimab-and-imdevimab cocktail target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are injected intravenously. Early trial data of the therapies found they could reduce hospitalization or emergency visits among high-risk patients.<br />“Physicians are not ordering the drug,” said Michael Ison, an infectious-disease physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital who is helping lead the monoclonal-antibody rollout there and in the wider Northwestern Medicine health system, which includes 10 hospitals across the Chicago area and northern Illinois.</td>

Meanwhile, Paris, now the bloc’s dominant foreign-policy actor, is driving debate on everything from relations with Washington and Moscow to expanding the EU’s military capabilities.<br />Last week’s Brexit agreement is due to be approved by EU governments on Tuesday and by the British parliament on Wednesday to allow it to come into force provisionally on Friday.

That total significantly surpassed write-downs taken over the same periods in 2015 and 2016, during the last oil bust, and is equivalent to roughly 10% of the companies’ collective market value.<br />Companies across the major Western economies are writing down more of their assets during the coronavirus pandemic than they have in years. But the oil industry has written down more than any other major segment of the economy, following an unprecedented collapse in global energy demand, according to an analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.<br />Oil producers frequently write down assets when commodity prices crash, as cash flows from oil-and-gas properties diminish. This year’s industrywide reappraisal is among its starkest ever because oil companies also face longer-term uncertainty over future demand for their main products amid the rise of electric cars, the proliferation of renewable energy and growing concern about the lasting impact of climate change.<br />European major oil companies  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC,  BP  PLC and  Total SE  were among the most aggressive cutters, accounting for more than one third of the industry’s write-downs this year. U.S. shale producers including  Concho Resources Inc.  and  Occidental Petroleum Corp.  booked more impairments than they had in the past four years combined.

      <td>Bruce Burnworth used to clip coupons and look for deals before his investment in  Tesla Inc.  made him a millionaire.<br />He is part of a widening class of affluent Americans who are doubling, or even tripling, down on this year’s highflying stock market. The S&P 500 has soared 66% since bottoming in March in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, while dozens of individual stocks, like Tesla, have surged even higher.<br />Some investors have been tempted to chase bigger gains—and have exposed themselves to potentially devastating losses—through riskier plays, such as concentrated positions, trading options and leveraged exchange-traded funds. Others are borrowing against their investment portfolios, pushing margin balances to the first record in more than two years, to buy even more stock.<br />Mr. Burnworth, a civil engineer in Incline Village, Nev., who is nearing retirement age, is using all of those strategies after turning a roughly $23,000 options gamble on Tesla last year into a nearly $2 million windfall. His growing Tesla stake had enabled him to borrow against his position to convert Tesla options into shares that have soared sevenfold this year. He says he also helped his daughter buy a home and purchased a Tesla sport-utility vehicle for another family member.<br />“Before, I wasn’t doing particularly well financially, Now, I’m well beyond where I wanted to be for retirement,” said Mr. Burnworth, who added that he also sold his own home and used some of the proceeds to buy more Tesla options.</td>

Between Jan. 1 and Dec. 20, the city recorded 1,824 shooting victims, up nearly 104% from 896 during the same period a year earlier, according to NYPD data.<br />The number of shootings increased to 1,493 for the year so far, compared with 754 for the same time in 2019, the data showed. A single shooting could end up with more than one victim, which accounts for the difference in totals between victims and incidents.<br />The Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice said people of color accounted for most of the victims.<br />An analysis of NYPD data by that office showed that 1,440 of 1,495 shooting victims between Jan. 1 to Oct. 1, or 96%, were either Black or Hispanic. During that period, 29 shooting victims were white.</td>

      <td>Valerie Green views her life as a series of major pivots. Some she initiated, but some she didn’t, including the latest, when she was laid off this spring.<br />Early in her working life, when she was getting started in architecture, a chance conversation with a colleague’s ex-girlfriend prompted her to leave her entry-level job at a New York firm and abandon her plan to apply to architecture school for an advanced degree. Instead, she enrolled in Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, where she studied product design.<br />For two decades, she worked at consulting firms where she helped clients formulate new products. Her last job in the field ended with a layoff six years ago, leading her to make the leap to human resources, a field where she could put her design thinking to use in a new, less tangible way.<br />That was a successful transition. But when she was laid off from her job in learning and development this year at Sonos, a maker of wireless home speakers, she felt paralyzed. “I still had a big crush on Sonos and I was really upset,” the 48-year-old says.<br />Ms. Green made a deal with herself: She would give herself the summer to shake off the hurt before she embarked on a job search. She increased the number of hours she was volunteering at local food pantries and got a third dog. “I was upset and I wasn’t going to make a good decision,” she says. “If you can take the time to heal, that will yield better results.”</td>

      <td>TOKYO—Shuichi Takatori spent two weeks in the hospital this fall with a fever after catching Covid-19. He recovered, went back to work and now feels fine.<br />But the disease lingered on in a different way—in the stigma Mr. Takatori says he felt from society. The 60-year-old member of Japan’s Parliament decided to disclose his illness, although he said he feared the consequences in next year’s election, and word quickly got around.<br />A restaurant where had dined called his office to ask for damages. The school basketball team of an aide’s child was disinvited from a tournament. And weeks after his recovery, he says relatives told him not to visit his hometown for a service on the first anniversary of his father’s death.<br />“I feel even now like it’s something embarrassing,” said Mr. Takatori, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.<br />Doctors say the shunning doesn’t make much medical sense, because people who have recovered from Covid-19 are typically no longer infectious. And public-health specialists say turning every infection into a moral failure—which is apt to be unfair, since the path of the virus is so random—can make the epidemic harder to control. For his part, Mr. Takatori said he was taking precautions and has no idea why he got sick.</td>

      <td>Sen. Ted Cruz helped rework program rules, enabling Wilks brothers and others in oil industry to get relief funding</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—As the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices walloped U.S. frackers this spring, Texas billionaires Dan and Farris Wilks got a $35 million relief loan to help one of their fracking companies stay afloat. At the same time, they were on a buying spree in the country’s oil patch.<br />Since spring, businesses controlled by the Wilks brothers have hunted for deals among fracking firms going through bankruptcy and taken or increased stakes in at least six other companies, corporate filings show. But when it looked like the oil-and-gas industry would be shut out of a key pandemic lending program, they and others in the industry turned their attention to Washington, making an appeal for help in meetings with home-state senator Ted Cruz.<br />The twin dynamics of acquisitions and government rescue show how the economic tumult caused by the pandemic has reshaped the landscape for a key U.S. industry. One result: The Wilkses have expanded their presence in a still-youthful industry where they first invested in 2002, soon to become billionaires as fracking flourished.<br />But the industry was already under pressure from international competition and a sagging oil price by the time the pandemic hit, and its mounting woes prompted the Wilkses and others to turn to allies in Washington, including Mr. Cruz. The Republican senator helped convince the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve to change the rules for pandemic loans to ensure oil and gas firms could participate.<br />Soon after the U.S. government changed the rules of its lending program in April, a Wilks family company, ProFrac Holdings LLC, applied for and received a $35 million loan, federal records show. ProFrac, a supplier of pumping equipment and services, is just one slice of the sprawling portfolio of fracking businesses that the Wilks family owns in part or outright across the American West and Canada.</td>

But the impact is far less, thanks in part to lessons learned by businesses, particularly in manufacturing, about how to keep workers safe and continue operating. The resurgence of East Asian economies, particularly China, has also buoyed many Western manufacturers.</td>

The measure passed with enough votes to override a potential presidential veto, but it was unclear Saturday whether Mr. Trump’s opposition would persuade any Republicans to reconsider.<br />On Saturday, Mr. Trump renewed his criticism of the legislation, calling on lawmakers to increase the direct coronavirus-relief payments to $2,000 for individuals from $600 per adult and per child, the current level in the bipartisan bill. He also targeted the $1.4 trillion government funding bill that was attached to the legislation, casting it as reckless spending at a time when federal resources should be focused on the economic recovery in the U.S.<br />“I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill. Also, stop the billions of dollars in ‘pork,’” Mr. Trump wrote on  Twitter  on Saturday. The president hasn’t said whether he intends to veto the legislation. Earlier this week, a copy of the bill was flown to Mar-a-Lago, the private Florida club where Mr. Trump is spending the holidays, in case he decides to sign it.</td>

By nightfall, the tree was at the curb, my mother’s mechanical Santas were in the attic and the breakable ornaments were safely packed away in what he called their “babble wrap” (he also was known for malapropisms).<br />My father attributed the fact that our house was always in perfect repair to his lists. As he said, “They keep me in line, Scrutt Butt.” (This was a nickname, probably a malapropism, he used interchangeably for me, my three brothers or any other dawdler he was fond of).<br />This month I resolved to make my own list of the home projects I have been avoiding, and tick them off one by one in 2021. But I ended up with 47 items on my list, and just looking at it overwhelmed me. So I played some online bridge and then I took a nap.<br />But shortly after I awoke, I heard a voice in my head, sort of like the Ghost of Post-Christmas Past, and it said, “Start by grouping similar tasks together, Scrutty. It’s not rocket science.”<br />I did that and came up with five categories of décor projects, which seemed like an improvement. And yet each seemed to represent its own circle of procrastination hell. So I sought professional help—not for the project itself but for ways to get oneself to actually tackle the job rather than goldbrick.</td>

As retailers learn to operate without stores, business travelers without airplanes, and workers without offices, much of what started out as a temporary expedient is likely to become permanent.<br />“Covid has acted like a time machine: it brought 2030 to 2020,” said Loren Padelford, vice president at  Shopify Inc.  “All those trends, where organizations thought they had more time, got rapidly accelerated.”  Merchants using the company’s e-commerce platform shot up more than 20% between January and June to 1.4 million, according to broker Robert W. Baird & Co.<br />The reverberations are already apparent in everything from the stock market to corporate spending patterns to the decline of physical cash. Investors in 2020 rewarded companies with digital-intensive, asset-light business models such as online used car seller  Carvana Co. , Airbnb Inc. and  Amazon.com Inc.  or firms that supply the infrastructure that makes those models possible—like Shopify,  Zoom Video Communications Inc.  and Microsoft Corp. Businesses are now spending less on office space and travel and more on cloud computing, collaboration software and logistics.<br />In many ways, digitization is simply the next chapter of a process under way for a century: the dematerialization of the economy. As agriculture gave way to manufacturing and then services, the share of economic value derived from tangible material and muscle shrunk while the share derived from information and brains grew. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan liked to note that economic output has steadily gotten lighter.</td>

Among other factors, Covid-19 has complicated face-to-face interviews and made it easier for masked suspects to elude capture.<br />Moreover, in some communities, trust in police has fallen amid nationwide protests over policing, making witnesses more reluctant to cooperate, some police officials say.</td>

      <td>Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin must surmount two congressional hurdles in his path to the Pentagon—a waiver, then confirmation</td>
      <td>Retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin’s four-decade military career was defined by breakthroughs: He was the first Black general to lead a division in combat, to command a theater of war, and to lead U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan.<br />Should Gen. Austin—President-elect Joe Biden’s choice to lead the Defense Department—be confirmed, he would become the first Black secretary in Defense Department history and would be the third recently retired general ever to lead the department.<br />Because of the latter, his confirmation process will require two congressional votes. The first would be by both chambers of Congress on whether to give Gen. Austin a waiver to hold the top Pentagon civilian job even though he has been out of uniform for only four years—short of the seven years required under laws safeguarding the tradition of civilian control of the military. The second vote would be the Senate confirmation vote.<br />Gen. Austin’s career was largely built in the Middle East, while defense leaders have said the biggest challenge to the U.S. now comes from China.<br />Leading up to his confirmation hearing, senators will have a small aperture into his potential policies as defense chief. While in the military, Gen. Austin was sometimes described as the “invisible general”  because of his unwillingness to speak publicly about military campaigns he led.</td>

      <td>Restaurant selection could shrink on food delivery platforms in the new year as regulation mounts</td>
      <td>Just how valuable has restaurant selection been to delivery platforms’ growth over the past year? We could soon find out.<br />A California bill is set to require third-party delivery platforms to have stated agreements in place with merchants to deliver food orders starting Jan. 1. The bill will effectively end the growth-strategy platforms including  DoorDash  and Postmates have historically employed to rapidly augment their delivery footprints. Delivery platforms will have to remove so-called unpartnered food merchants, or those with which they don’t have a stated agreement, from their apps in California. Without an agreement, a delivery platform can list a restaurant’s menu without permission, sometimes leading to complications for restaurants like dining rooms crowded with unexpected delivery people or orders for items the kitchen no longer makes.<br />While users might be in for a shock, the companies themselves have been preparing. DoorDash, for example, said in its public-offering filing that over 95% of its gross order value came from partnered merchants in the nine months ended Sept. 30. Similarly,  Uber Technologies ’ Uber Eats said it grew active partnered restaurants by 70% year over year in the third quarter.<br />The California bill won’t affect all players equally. The impact on Postmates, whose largest market is Los Angeles, could be disproportionately large. Postmates has 700,000 merchants on its platform, according to a September regulatory filing from Uber.<br />Of those, only 115,000 were partnered at that time, according to the company.</td>

Special pandemic-related programs and extra financial assistance have assisted workers who lost jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and related shutdowns.<br />More than 22 million jobs were lost in March and April at the beginning of the pandemic. Through November, about 12 million have been recovered.<br />Here is what we know about the status of the payment programs:<br />One program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance has been available to the self-employed, gig workers and others not typically eligible for unemployment aid. The other, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, provided up to 13 weeks of additional payments to individuals who exhausted other programs that pay benefits, such as regular state unemployment benefits.<br />Regular state programs aren’t affected.

Meanwhile,  Airbnb Inc.  opened this month at a valuation of $102 billion, the largest in a series of blockbuster U.S. listings, while China’s JD Health International Inc. made its debut in Hong Kong at a market capitalization of roughly $38 billion, capping a bumper year for IPOs there.<br />Japan lacks the self-reinforcing mix of young innovators and financiers that has made places like Silicon Valley and Hangzhou in China, hotbeds of growth. But venture capitalists and entrepreneurs say things are improving. The amount of money startups raise in Japan has increased by more than seven times over the past seven years, to about $4.8 billion in 2019, according to Tokyo-based data tracker Initial Inc.<br />Venture funds are getting bigger, and the government is pouring in money. A unit of government-owned Japan Investment Corp., or JIC, created a $1.2 billion venture-capital fund this year, the country’s biggest. In recent weeks, it invested nearly $100 million into an initial group of seven companies.</td>

Online sales grew 47.2% during that time, said the firm. The tally excludes sales of gas and autos.<br />That is below the 3.6% to 5.2% sales growth predicted by the National Retail Federation, an industry group, last month. A more complete picture of holiday spending will emerge in the coming weeks as the government reports December retail-sales figures and retailers report financial results.<br />“It’s going to be modest compared to what we have seen in the past,” said Rod Sides, head of the retail and distribution practice at consulting firm Deloitte LLP. Mr. Sides said sales are likely to rise a few percentage points, boosted by big-box and online retailers, as a surge in Covid-19 cases in recent months and new restrictions on public gatherings weighed on results. “The folks that are playing catch-up,” in retail, he said, “continued to play catch up.”</td>

      <td>To keep fit while working from home during the Covid pandemic, a data analyst in Brooklyn got on his bike—and set himself an ambitious target</td>
      <td>When a winter storm blanketed the Northeast in snow and ice this month, most outdoor exercisers shifted to an indoor workout. But Stephen Arthur, a 53-year-old IT specialist in the North Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, was 28 miles away from cycling 10,000 miles in 2020. Determined to reach his goal before year’s end, he put knobby, snow-worthy tires on his mountain bike and bundled up. Mr. Arthur didn’t have the target in mind when 2020 began, but when the pandemic hit, cycling preserved his sanity.<br />He used to bike 2 miles round trip to work. “It was an easy way to turn my commute into exercise,” he said. When he began working from home in March during lockdown, there were days when he never left his 650-square-foot apartment or spoke with anyone, except on Zoom. “Getting outdoors to bike became the highlight of my day,” he said. “I kept waiting for the governor or mayor to say you can’t ride your bike, but instead they encouraged people to get outside and exercise.”<br />Pre-pandemic, Mr. Arthur would use vacations to take multi-day, solo bike tours in different countries. Unable to travel, he now uses weekends to explore Brooklyn by bike. “I thought I knew the city,” said Mr. Arthur, who grew up in Bergen County, N.J. “Now, I’ve gotten to know it on a whole other level.”<br />When his mom died in May, cycling became an outlet for grief. Weekend rides got longer, taking him along the Hudson River or to Coney Island or to Rockaway Beach in Queens. “I probably cycled at least four centuries in September,” he said, referring to rides of 100 miles or longer.<br /></td>

      <td>Faced with a rapid deterioration in their finances in 2020, America’s colleges and universities issued a record amount of bonds this year.<br />It is a stressful time for higher education. The coronavirus pandemic worsened existing pressures on tuition and auxiliary revenue, with international students opting to study outside the U.S. and money from room and board drying up as schools keep classes online. At the same time, demand for financial aid and costs related to providing protective gear and Covid-19 testing have jumped.<br />Hoping to address possible shortfalls and take advantage of ultralow rates, universities have flooded the market with debt. With few places to get a return in the bond market, investors have scooped up the issues, which in some cases offer yields of 2% or 3% for debt that matures in 15 to 30 years.<br />The higher-education sector “becomes attractive because it’s under pressure,” said Daniel Solender, who oversees tax-free fixed-income investments at asset manager Lord Abbett & Co., referring to rising yields on higher-education bonds as schools’ ability to navigate the pandemic came into question. The firm added more than $300 million to its holdings of such bonds this year.<br />“There are a lot of high-quality institutions with great reputations, great balance sheets, that will find a way to make it through this environment,” he said.</td>

Now, more are introducing vehicle features that aim to make driving in rush-hour traffic or on road trips less taxing.<br />Some new systems allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel on highways or in heavy congestion, using sensors, radar and cameras to automatically keep the car centered, control speed and even to change lanes.<br />General Motors Co.  was the first major car company to promote such capabilities in 2017 with its hands-free Super Cruise feature, which can be activated on most U.S. highways by pushing a button on the steering wheel that enables the car to take over steering and speed control.</td>

Democrats have 222 seats to Republicans’ 211, with two races uncalled, making getting the 218 votes necessary tough. More than 40 lawmakers have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began, and Democrats don’t want to further dent their majority if members fall ill.<br />Mrs. Pelosi faced no opposition within her party to remain the leader.

I enjoy the discussions, but why don’t I seem to like watching the movies as much anymore? —Jack<br /><br />Research has shown that when people do something together, shared emotions are amplified, making the activity feel more intense and engaging. That’s especially true if there’s an exciting or emotional component to the activity, as with an action movie. To bring back some of the experience you’re missing, try organizing a watch-party where everyone streams the movie at the same time. Knowing you’re part of a group experience, even in virtual form, can bring back some of the excitement until you can start meeting in person again.</td>

Metropolitan Nashville Police Department spokesman Don Aaron called the event “significant” and videos showed damage to businesses in the area and fires burning.<br />Local officials described a harrowing early morning scenario leading up to the blast, which took place at 6:30 a.m. Authorities said dozens of people were evacuated from hotels and other buildings. Local police officers initially responded to a 5:30 a.m. report of gunshots in the downtown area. As they arrived, they found a suspicious recreational vehicle on Second Avenue North outside the  AT&T  building. A recording coming from the vehicle said that a potential bomb would detonate within 15 minutes, Police Chief John Drake said.<br />From there, officers began an immediate evacuation of the area. Shortly after that, the vehicle exploded. Police said it was unclear if anyone was inside the RV at the time.<br />Officers “heard announcements coming from this vehicle, took them seriously, and were working to seal the streets to protect folks,” Mr. Aaron said. “We think lives were saved,” said Mr. Aaron of the rush evacuation.</td>

      <td>LONDON—Business groups are calling for more time to adjust to Britain’s new trade agreement with the European Union, saying new rules set to come into force next week risk disrupting the $590 billion-plus annual trade in goods that previously flowed freely.<br />The U.K. and EU said Thursday they had signed an agreement over their future relations, setting the seal on the 2016 British referendum decision to leave the bloc. That was a relief for businesses that feared four years of politically charged negotiations could end without a trade pact, resulting in tariffs on goods for both sides.<br />But despite the reprieve, for the first time in almost half a century, food, motor vehicles and other goods moving between the EU and U.K. will from Jan. 1 face customs checks and need to meet separate sets of standards and regulations.<br />The British government estimates there will be 215 million extra customs declarations a year, nearly 600,000 a day, which businesses say will take time and cost money to organize. Some companies will need to pay inspection fees, seek import licenses and figure out how to account for value-added tax. British food and animal exports to the EU will be checked on arrival, while some professional qualifications will no longer be automatically recognized. Some businesses say they don’t yet know fully how they will respond because they have yet to see the details of the trade agreement.<br />Predicting long lines at British and European ports, and reams of new paperwork, business groups are now calling on both the U.K. and EU to help companies navigate the changes and mitigate any new frictions to trade, including giving firms time to adjust to new rules.</td>

      <td>His aunt was the life of the party and the ruler of the roost. But her past was a set of intricate, purposeful mysteries.</td>
      <td>Haven’t we all wished for an aunt like Ferdinand Mount’s Aunt Betty? A stylish, darting little woman nicknamed Munca, she loved having her nephew spend childhood summers at her Sussex house (complete with chauffeur, nanny, cook, maid) and, in later years, ferried him up to London in her Rolls-Royce to meet theater friends at the Café de Paris. One memorable encounter in 1957, for example, was with the aging trouper Sophie Tucker. “This is my nephew,” Aunt Betty proudly declared of the mortified teenager. “He’s going to be a writer.” To which Tucker responded, “That’s swell . . . I’ve always had a lot of time for the guy with the pencil.”<br />A family photograph from the previous year says it all: Betty; her husband, Greig; their daughter, Georgie; and Ferdinand’s sister, Francie, smiling—and the young writer standing just apart unmistakably “glum and ungrateful.” For Betty was, in many ways, just too much. Whether plumping up the cushions in her chic drawing room, deadheading her rosebushes or igniting a drinks party, she seemed always to attack and overwhelm.<br />Just how much more there was to this armor-clad butterfly is revealed—incrementally and irresistibly—in “Kiss Myself Goodbye: The Many Lives of Aunt Munca,” a family history so deftly excavated and winningly conjured that it restores our faith in a literary species too often given to flabbiness and self-absorption. “It is a personal memoir that turned into a quest while I wasn’t looking,” Mr. Mount explains of his decade-long exhumation of a past riddled with as many deceptions and double-crosses as any espionage novel. “In this book, nobody’s recollections are reliable,” he cautions. And isn’t that putting it mildly.<br />All begins, as it must, with a birth. “Betty just went off to Cornwall and came back with a baby,” Ferdinand’s mother announces of her sister-in-law. Arriving in 1941, Georgie was Betty and Grieg’s golden girl and their only child until, sometime in 1950, “an adopted baby sister suddenly arrives, out of the blue, like a food parcel during the war.” Georgie and her Mount cousins adore chubby little Celeste. Then one day, she’s gone. “We just borrowed her to help her parents out,” Betty explains, and that’s that.<br />The mystery of the borrowed baby nags at Mr. Mount, as do other, seemingly related conundrums of Betty’s life: her ruthless sabotaging of Georgie’s marriage plans, the serial romances of her past, her hazy connection to her jaunty brother Buster, her real age—her real name(s), for heaven’s sake. “I had tugged the thread,” he writes of his growing curiosity, “and I could not resist following it to the end.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Trump is spending Christmas at his private Florida club and President-elect Joe Biden will remain in Delaware, the unofficial headquarters of his transition to the White House.<br />In a statement released by the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump thanked front-line medical workers, law enforcement and first responders.<br />“Your daily contributions are an example of the selfless love of God and remind us of the noble principles we strive to live by, especially during this special time of year,” he said.<br />Later, the president said on Twitter he would give brief remarks to U.S. service members across the world via videoconference, with “Fake News not invited!”<br />Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday night after vetoing a $740.5 billion defense-policy bill and demanding that lawmakers revise a coronavirus-aid package that funds the federal government. The president issued a string of pardons, including of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, longtime adviser Roger Stone, and Charles Kushner, his son-in-law’s father. He is expected to remain at Mar-a-Lago until the New Year.</td>

      <td>The Congressional Review Act could swiftly undo Trump successes.</td>
      <td>If Democrats control the Senate next month after Georgia’s runoffs, say a quick goodbye to President Trump’s recent deregulation. With full control of Washington, Democrats could use the Congressional Review Act to annul the Trump Administration’s handiwork, as Republicans undid Barack Obama’s. The good news: More of Mr. Trump’s efforts are now safe from the CRA, thanks to the wrangling over virus relief.<br />The CRA lets lawmakers nix regulations published in the previous 60 legislative days, with a similar “lookback” period for a new Congress. That review window moves: Whenever lawmakers dither in D.C., the CRA review period for their successors gets later on the calendar. Judging by Congress’s schedules, analysts thought new rules from the Trump Administration might be at risk beginning as early as May.<br />That would put in jeopardy some big items on Mr. Trump’s agenda. This summer the Administration finished overhauling environmental reviews, the goal being to prevent endless projects like Denver’s 13-year study of a 12-mile road expansion. That deregulation will be crucial for the success of any big infrastructure bill. But the new rule wasn’t finished until July 16, and at the time it seemed within the CRA’s window.<br />Legislative dysfunction to the rescue: Congress later added days to its session as it worked toward a scrupulous agreement—that’s a joke—on this week’s 5,593-page omnibus to fund the government, provide Covid relief, create new Smithsonian museums, and Make Business Lunches Great Again. Now the CRA’s review period in 2021 might not reach back further than August, although the precise window won’t be clear until lawmakers deal with Mr. Trump’s veto threat.<br />Plenty is still at risk, including the new rules the Trump Administration might finish before the inaugural oath is delivered on Jan. 20. The Labor Department recently adopted a rule saying retirement-plan fiduciaries must pick investments “solely on financial considerations,” meaning no settling for lower returns in exchange for fewer carbon emissions.</td>

      <td>Political clemency will inevitably follow political prosecutions.</td>
      <td>President Trump’s flurry of pardons and grants of clemency this week are being denounced far and wide, and many of them appear to be undeserved, or worse. But the critics would have more credibility if they tried to understand why tens of millions of Americans will discount these as the Andrew Weissmann pardons.<br />Mr. Weissmann is the former deputy to special counsel Robert Mueller on the Russia collusion probe. He’s a Democratic partisan who can be seen even now on MSNBC suggesting that Mr. Trump obstructed justice in the probe that never turned up evidence of collusion. He and his fellow prosecutors spent two years, with the full resources of the federal government, trying to prove a case that didn’t exist.<br />Instead they indicted individuals in the Trump orbit of crimes unrelated to their main purpose. They pursued Paul Manafort on a foreign-lobbying statute that is rarely enforced and then turned up evidence of tax fraud. They coerced George Papadopoulos and Alex van der Zwaan into copping pleas on a single count of making false statements. Roger Stone was convicted of obstructing a Congressional investigation.<br />Mr, Manafort’s tax offenses are serious crimes, and that’s how a jury saw them. He and Mr. Stone, former business partners, have long been political scoundrels of the type Mr. Trump likes to have around him. But there’s no doubt they were targeted not for their specific offenses but because they associated with Mr. Trump. Prosecutors were out to get Mr. Trump—many of them still are—and they were happy to take down others in the hope they would have evidence against the President.<br />Yet the targeted men had nothing to offer beyond what prosecutors turned up from other sources. It was inevitable that Mr. Trump would pardon these former associates before he left office. If the good and righteous want to avoid political pardons, they should be more critical of political prosecutions.</td>

The 5,593-page year-end package passed both chambers of Congress with broad bipartisan support, and the president only publicly registered his frustrations after lawmakers approved the legislation.<br />The president called on lawmakers to increase the direct payments to $2,000 for individuals from $600 per adult and per child, the current level in the bipartisan bill. He also criticized the spending portion of legislation, which includes routine funding for foreign allies and international programs.<br />“Why would politicians not want to give people $2000, rather than only $600? It wasn’t their fault, it was China,” the president wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Give our people the money!”<br />The president delegated negotiations to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and played little role in the monthslong talks over the bill. He hasn’t told lawmakers whether he intends to veto it, furthering the uncertainty about the fate of the package.</td>

      <td>The musician behind many chart-topping classics calls himself ‘a master of nothing who could do a few things at once</td>
      <td>Michael McDonald is one of the most recognizable voices of his generation. He wrote and sang songs that have topped the airwaves for decades, including “Takin’ It to the Streets,” “What a Fool Believes” and “Minute by Minute” with his Doobie Brothers bandmates, as well as “I Keep Forgettin’” as a solo artist. But to hear Mr. McDonald tell it, he was something of an accidental superstar, “a master of nothing who could do a few things at once: play some piano, write some songs, sing background.”<br />He was recently inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Doobie Brothers. The ceremony, originally planned for May 2020, was postponed and then turned into an HBO special—one pandemic adjustment that he says he didn’t much mind. “I love getting awards and am honored to do so, but I’m socially inept at these events,” he says with a laugh. “The last time I went to the Grammys, I was the only one in a tuxedo, so I was actually relieved that we didn’t have to go through the whole thing. It fits my personality to stay home and watch it on television.”<br />Mr. McDonald, 68, had a modest attitude when the Doobie Brothers brought him aboard in 1975 as a temporary substitute for their ailing frontman Tom Johnston, and little seems to have changed since. “I look back on my career and realize that blind ignorance allowed me to succeed,” he says over the phone from his Santa Barbara, Calif., home. “I kind of overanalyze things, and if that’s self-deprecation, so be it. I call it being a little more in touch with reality. I look back on my music and feel so blessed that people like it. But do I think it’s the greatest stuff I’ve ever heard? No. That’s just the reality.”<br />As a child in Ferguson, Mo., Mr. McDonald played banjo to accompany his father, who used to sing Tin Pan Alley and ragtime songs, before moving on to keyboards and Top 40 cover bands. He later mastered Motown tunes, which deepened his love of R&B.<br />In 1970, an 18-year-old Mr. McDonald moved to Los Angeles. He recorded demos for RCA Records while working as a keyboardist and background vocalist on recordings with members of the legendary “Wrecking Crew” band of superb session musicians, who graced thousands of songs by all sorts of artists. The experience “was transformative,” Mr. McDonald says. “I learned studio skills from some of the greatest ever to do it.”</td>

      <td>The pandemic offers a unique opportunity to fix the housing crisis plaguing rural America.</td>
      <td>With the Covid-19 pandemic has come the rise of remote work, and rural America is having a moment. Searches on RedFin and Zillow show upticks in interest in rural areas, as more Americans determine to flee the cities for greener pastures.<br />Finding a house in rural America, however, may be easier said than done. Consider Orange County, Ind.—population 19,840 in 2010—which is in many ways a model for rural America. It has a thriving arts community, a local food co-op and a farmers’ market, interesting ecological and natural features such as the Rise at Orangeville natural spring and Hoosier National Forest, and a rich history, with a name deriving from the Dutch Protestant House of Orange.<br />And it has wide open spaces—too wide open. There simply isn’t enough housing for the people who want to live there. This counterintuitive housing shortage is having a devastating effect on rural America’s economy.<br />At first glance, Orange County’s housing shortage doesn’t make sense. One would think building in rural America would be easy. There is plenty of cheap land; zoning rules are generally less restrictive; and employers are struggling to fill job openings. Yet the housing crunch is an enormous struggle. In 2017 there were a mere 79,000 single-family home starts in all of “nonmetropolitan” America, compared with 223,800 in 2005.<br />One explanation is the unwillingness of banks to extend loans to contractors or developers looking to build housing where there are no comparison properties nearby. And given the relatively small, sometimes stagnant housing markets in rural areas, there are often few such “comps.” Without them, there can be no loans. Without loans, there can be no building.</td>

      <td>Behind the paradox lies a superstition about history that may explain their viciousness and violence.</td>
      <td>It is impossible to read Mark Twain in the 21st century without being aware, each time one encounters it, of the single most unspeakable word in the English language today; a word that in Twain’s time was as common as mud and therefore completely unremarkable on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line. The issue concerning the appropriateness of designating “Huckleberry Finn” and “Tom Sawyer” in their original and unexpurgated state as assigned reading in English classes in the public schools has troubled teachers and administrators since at least the 1990s.<br />I am not concerned here with the question of whether the bowdlerization of these texts is defensible, a moral imperative, or an offense against literature—New South published a sanitized edition of the two books in 2011—but rather with the paradoxical character of postmodern political correctness. That character was exposed, also in 2011, when the Virginia Department of Education adopted a textbook, “Our Virginia: Past and Present” by Joy Masoff, which contained the claim that “thousands of Southern blacks fought in the Confederate ranks, including two under the command of Stonewall Jackson.” That prompted anger and indignation on the left and an advisory to teachers from the department to ignore the passage.<br />Yet it is a historically confirmed fact that many Southern blacks, freemen as well as slaves, fought on the side of the Confederacy, as attested to by the historian William Freehling and documented by Harvard’s Prof. John Stauffer in an essay for TheRoot.com. Even so, many Civil War historians continue to deny it for ideological reasons.<br />The dispute over the existence of black Confederate soldiers is a clear instance of how radical progressives, in their war on America, have been pursuing two contradictory aims at once. First, they have worked tirelessly to expose what they view as the fundamentally and indelibly racist character of America from its inception. Thus the central purpose of the “1619 Project,” conceived by Nikole Hannah-Jones and subsequently developed by the  New York Times  magazine: to rewrite, edit and otherwise “correct” the history of the American Republic. Second, they have sought to sanitize America’s cultural achievements and thereby satisfy the moral demands of the present time, all for the good of future generations.<br />No one has noticed, or at any rate pointed out, the basic contradictoriness of exposing, emphasizing, and displaying our national sins on the one hand, while on the other trying to obliterate every trace of them from historical record.</td>

      <td>An ill-conceived bid to turn Massachusetts foster parents into salaried government employees.</td>
      <td>Service Employees International Union Local 509 launched an effort in October to organize Massachusetts foster parents, claiming that it would “amplify foster parent voices in order to make meaningful repairs to our broken system.” In reality, unionizing foster parents would turn them into salaried government employees, creating a conflict of interest for Local 509. The union represents child welfare agency caseworkers, who are frequently the target of complaints from foster parents.<br />“I always hated the idea that kids don’t have a safe place to be,” says Rachel, a single woman who lives in a Boston suburb (names have been changed to protect the privacy of foster children and to protect foster parents from retaliation). She has wanted to be a foster parent since she was a teenager. She told the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families that she would happily take in an older child—something not enough foster families are willing to do—but that she couldn’t manage a child with severe behavioral problems. Rachel had volunteered for years with special-needs kids but knew that, as a single parent, she could only handle so much.<br />DCF didn’t listen. When 12-year-old Alexa (also an alias) showed up at the door, she had been in other foster homes for almost a year, including a stint with her grandmother that ended because of Alexa’s violent temper. She had thrown chairs at school and threatened kids at camp. Because of her history, no family members were willing to take her in. But no one told Rachel. Instead, only a single box was checked off on the form listing Alexa’s challenges—hygiene. It’s true that in the months that Alexa lived in Rachel’s home she smeared feces on the wall, but that was one of the less frightening incidents. Rachel finally told DCF after 10 months that she couldn’t handle Alexa anymore.<br />“Either they were negligent or deliberately held back information from me,” Rachel says. “They just said whatever they had to in order to get her into my home.”<br />Rachel’s experience with DCF is the tip of the iceberg. A devastating 2019 exposé in the Boston Globe revealed that “2,000 families have stopped accepting foster children in the past five years—almost as many as the total number of foster families currently in the system.” The department never asked these parents why they quit. When the Globe did, they uncovered stories of parents who were never told about kids’ medical problems, behavioral issues or past-traumatic experiences.</td>

      <td>The original cover art for ‘The Blue Lotus,’ an artistic breakthrough for the cartoonist Hergé, will be auctioned in Paris next month.</td>
      <td>‘It’s too good for children!” exclaimed Georges Remi about “The Blue Lotus,” the fifth in his series of comic books about the intrepid boy reporter Tintin. Remi—better known to readers by his pen name Hergé—created the character in 1929 for a Belgian newspaper, but it was the books that made Tintin world-famous: 23 were published before the cartoonist’s death in 1983. When “The Blue Lotus” appeared in 1936, Hergé was 29 years old and approaching the peak of his powers as an artist. “In terms of quality there is a before and after ‘The Blue Lotus,’” says Eric Leroy, comic strip expert for the Artcurial auction house in Paris.<br />On Jan. 14, Artcurial will auction the original cover art for “The Blue Lotus,” in Indian ink, watercolor and gouache on paper. It shows Tintin and his dog Snowy poking their heads out of a Ming vase to confront a giant trompe-l’oeil dragon painted on the wall behind them; both parties look surprised by the encounter. The presale high estimate for the cover art is $3.4 million, just below Hergé’s auction record of $3.6 million, set in 2014.<br />Like his creator, Tintin is a French-speaking Belgian, but his adventures take him all over the world, and readers were drawn by Hergé’s carefully researched renderings of exotic locales. The first books in the series took Tintin and his faithful companions on eventful missions to the U.S.S.R., the Belgian Congo, Egypt and the U.S. In “The Blue Lotus” he travels to China, where he witnesses Japanese imperialism and risks his life to break up an international opium-smuggling ring.<br />The cover art at auction next month is unique. When Hergé submitted it to his publisher Louis Casterman, the art was deemed too costly to reproduce using the standard four-color printing method. Hergé came up with a simpler version for use in the book but gave the original to Casterman’s young son, who folded it in six and stored it in a drawer. His heirs have now decided to sell the drawing. “I’d say it’s the most beautiful artwork by Hergé on the market that remains in private hands,” says Mr. Leroy.<br />One of Hergé’s inspirations for the drawing was a magazine cover that showed the actress Anna May Wong, star of the 1932 film “Shanghai Express,” posing against a red dragon backdrop. Michael Farr reproduced the image in his 2001 book “Tintin: The Complete Companion,” which traces the real-life sources of Tintin’s adventures. Mr. Farr, who met Hergé in 1978, describes him as a “journalist manqué”: “That’s why he created Tintin, who was the dashing foreign correspondent he aspired to be.”</td>

You know, the house we lived in when we were still married.”<br />In the scripted drama, produced by Qcode Media, Ms. Moore plays an accountant who secretly runs a website that streams audio of women sharing their intimate desires. The original plan was to record the show with a cast on a sound stage, but when the pandemic hit, the production went online and the actors interacted with each other remotely over Zoom, from makeshift studios in closets and spare rooms at home.<br />“I went to different rooms and recorded myself and said, hey, which one sounds the best?” Ms. Moore said in a recent Zoom call. “It ended up being my bathroom.”<br />A-list celebrities like Matthew McConaughey, Kristen Wiig, Rami Malek and Cynthia Erivo are turning to scripted fiction podcasts with the production qualities of TV and film—just without the pictures. Alongside film, TV and theater, scripted podcasts have become a popular, somewhat pandemic-proof medium for actors and writers to tell ambitious stories.</td>

      <td>Countries that are among the hardest hit by the coronavirus also must contend with limited funds and logistical difficulties</td>
      <td>Three Latin American countries administered their first doses of vaccines against Covid-19 on Thursday, as the region hardest hit by the pandemic begins what health officials say will be a long slog toward inoculating the masses.<br />Ten thousand  Pfizer Inc.  vaccines shipped by air from Belgium landed in Costa Rica and Chile as both countries kicked off a vaccination drive that is expected to speed up in early 2021 with the arrival of millions more doses. Mexico began administering 3,000 doses from Pfizer, and Argentina will start inoculations next week after 300,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine arrived Thursday from Moscow on an Argentine state aircraft.<br />The first injections in Mexico and Chile were broadcast live on television.<br />“It was something unexpected, I’m very excited,” said Zulema Riquelme, a 46-year-old Chilean nurse who works with Covid-19 patients and became the first in that country to receive the vaccine. “These have been difficult months because I haven’t been able to see my family, a lot of exhaustion. I feel proud that they chose me.”<br />The arrival of the vaccines, which most countries are administering first to front-line health-care workers before giving them to the elderly, offers a glimmer of hope for a region of 650 million that has logged over 470,000 deaths from Covid-19, about 30% of the world’s total, and more than 14 million cases. With a new surge of deaths and cases now hammering the region, health officials in most countries are still negotiating purchases with pharmaceutical companies or awaiting delivery of vaccines early next year.</td>

      <td>Taking on both jobs at once, David Kenny is staking his reputation directly on racial equity and inclusion at the media-ratings company</td>
      <td>When  Nielsen Holdings  PLC’s top diversity executive stepped down after 12 years in the role, the company started looking for a hire.<br />Its new chief executive, David Kenny—at that point in the top job for only a few months—raised his hand.<br />Mr. Kenny took on the additional title in February of 2019. Fifteen months later, George Floyd’s killing by police sparked widespread protests and a national conversation on race. Since then, CEOs across industries have pledged to do more to advance racial equality in their workplaces.<br />By adding diversity chief to his job title last year, Mr. Kenny, age 59, is staking his reputation directly on the issue. Mr. Kenny, who is white, said he wants to ensure racial representation in the workplace gets the attention it deserves. “You get a big microphone when you’re a CEO,” he said.<br />Diversity is central to Nielsen’s business mission, he said. As a company that quantifies how people shop and consume TV and other media, its fortunes are tied to helping marketers understand different demographics.</td>

When she logged into the family’s shared Amazon account, Ms. Juane, 21, inadvertently glimpsed a ukulele that her parents had purchased as her gift. She told her brother, who said she should feign surprise on Christmas.<br />Ms. Juane spent a night mulling it over before telling her parents what she’d seen. “I didn’t want them to be disappointed if I couldn’t be, like, ‘Oh, my gosh!’” says Ms. Juane, a day-care worker in Dallas.<br />This holiday season has seen a boom in online shopping. Yet with so many families buying gifts through shared accounts, digital indiscretions are wreaking havoc on many Christmas surprises. At the same time, millions of Americans receiving gifts shipped from loved ones are finding the parade of identical cardboard boxes can be hard to distinguish from their own purchases—with many mistakenly opening their presents long before Christmas morning.<br />When a package arrived on Aimee Truchan’s doorstep in San Diego earlier this month, she did what she always does and casually slit it open.</td>

      <td>Trade deal will lessen early turbulence, but disruption comes at a challenging time</td>
      <td>LONDON—The free-trade agreement that the U.K. struck with the European Union on Christmas Eve will heap new challenges onto a British economy that has performed worse than its peers through 2020.<br />While avoiding a trade disruption of the magnitude that would have followed if efforts to reach a deal had failed, the new agreement is the first in history that will throw more obstacles in the way of importers and exporters. That is happening as the U.K. copes with a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus that has forced lockdowns over most of the country.<br />On Christmas Day, ambassadors from the 27 EU countries met in Brussels to begin scrutinizing the agreement, ahead of its expected approval by governments next week. The British Parliament is set to meet on Dec. 30 to ratify the accord.<br />It will take effect with the U.K. and economies across the world already straining under the pandemic and governments’ efforts to contain it. The U.K. has been among the worst-hit economies, with gross domestic product at the end of the third quarter almost 10% less than it was a year earlier.<br />Britain will have to adjust to the new relationship with the EU as it simultaneously deals with the economic pain caused by the virus. That risks hindering a recovery, economists and business executives say, with unpredictable consequences for jobs and livelihoods as businesses adapt to the upheavals of both challenges.</td>

      <td>Architecture group AIA has lofty goals for putting up energy-efficient structures. Much work remains.</td>
      <td>The American Institute of Architects has for years challenged its members to design buildings to combat climate change, setting a goal to hit “net zero” edifices by 2030.<br />The architects have a ways to go. Last year, 27 of the 19,000 building-design firms owned by AIA members reported meeting their annual mark. That figure was an improvement: 16 firms met targets the year before, and 11 the year before that.<br />Buildings generate a surprisingly large share of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. About 40% of annual emissions in the U.S. come from heating, lighting, cooling and constructing buildings, according to the AIA.<br />The architects learned a lesson when trying to meet their green challenge, one that applies broadly to industrywide efforts to address climate change: Customers have to want the products first.<br />“The architecture profession tends to give what the client asks for and the vast majority of clients aren’t asking” for green structures, said Mike Fowler, a senior associate at Mithun Inc., a Seattle-based architecture firm that was among the few to hit the mark. Mithun always presents at least one energy-efficient design option to clients and works to educate them on climate benefits and potential cost savings, he said.</td>
