      <td>In address on eve of expected ouster from party leadership, congresswoman says ex-president is undermining democracy</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) said Republicans who ignored former President Donald Trump’s continuing false claims of a stolen election were undermining democracy, in a defiant speech on the House floor on the eve of a vote expected to oust her from the House GOP’s top ranks.<br />House Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday morning to remove her as chairwoman of the House GOP conference, after weeks of tension between Ms. Cheney and other party leaders over Mr. Trump’s role in inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol and his future in leading the Republican Party. GOP leaders have emphasized party unity, including with Mr. Trump, while Ms. Cheney has insisted that the GOP cut ties with the former president.<br />“Remaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar,” Ms. Cheney said on the House floor Tuesday evening. “I will not participate in that. I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former president’s crusade to undermine our democracy.”<br />Mr. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House earlier this year over actions related to the riot, in which his supporters stormed the Capitol building as Congress was gathered to formalize Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Mr. Trump was acquitted in the Senate.<br />Mr. Trump has claimed that the election was stolen from him, and he has continued to make unfounded allegations after Mr. Biden took office. In a statement Tuesday, he said the election was “rigged and stolen from us.”</td>

      <td>China is aging more rapidly than many expected, posing a serious challenge to its economic model</td>
      <td>China is graying much more rapidly than many demographers expected. That won’t be enough to derail its rise—but it will pose a serious challenge to its savings and export-heavy economic model. It could also mean a markedly smaller Chinese economy by midcentury than most mainstream economists expect.<br />The top-line results of China’s once-a-decade census were released Tuesday, showing a sharp drop in births and a steeper drop in the working age population than expected. China’s fertility rate is now just 1.3 children per woman, in the same league as aging societies such as Japan and Italy. Originally the results had been due in April, prompting widespread speculation that the numbers would be bad.<br />China is far from the only major country with a demographic problem—the U.S. fertility rate dropped to just 1.64 in 2020. But what is striking about the latest Chinese figures is how fast they are now diverging from previous estimates. According to official figures, China’s population between 15 and 64 years of age was 967 million in 2020—down a full 35 million from 2015. The latest version of the United Nations’ core fertility scenario assumed China wouldn’t drop to that level until well after 2030.<br />Besides the obvious need to completely scrap the remaining vestiges of China’s longstanding policies to limit births, Beijing has some other levers it can pull to offset the drag on the labor force: raising the retirement age, easing controls on internal migration, helping companies increase automation, or dramatically boosting immigration. With the exception of automation all of these are politically very tricky, however—especially the last.<br />Moreover, a rapidly aging population presents unique challenges for China’s growth model, which until now has relied heavily on productivity-driving exports and a high savings rate to help offset the significant downsides of the very large state presence in the economy. Working-age populations often save more for the future, while the elderly spend down their savings or rely on their children or the government.</td>

      <td>Apprehensions in both groups dropped for first time in a year, but the number of single adults caught entering the U.S. illegally continued to rise</td>
      <td>The number of migrant families and unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally dropped in April for the first time in nearly a year, according to government data disclosed Tuesday.<br />Customs and Border Protection agents arrested 48,226 migrants traveling as families and 16,933 children who arrived on their own. Arrests for each of those groups of migrants declined by about 10% compared with March.<br />However, arrests of single adults rose by about 11.5% to 108,301. As a result, the number of arrests by CBP ticked up slightly from March, to about 173,400. That means the Biden administration is still on pace to preside over a 20-year high in illegal border crossings by the end of the federal budget year in September.<br />The number of adults crossing is likely lower than the arrest totals because many attempt to cross the border repeatedly after being caught and returned to Mexico.<br />There are likely multiple reasons for April’s dropoff in families and children crossing the border. Significant among them is stepped-up immigration enforcement by Mexico, which has been more carefully policing its southern border with Guatemala as well as common migrant routes through the country, at the behest of the U.S. government.</td>

Expectations from instructors were high—anything less than perfection would warrant expulsion from the program.<br />Soon academic failure deemed me unworthy of this advanced education. Overlooked was the social context that primed me to struggle. Extreme poverty and hazardous living conditions brought stress; I had to disregard my education to find a safe place to live. Rather than investigate the causes of my unusual academic decline, teachers labeled me another lazy student. I was dropped from the gifted program.</td>

      <td>The unconstitutional pieces of H.R.1 could blow up the midterms.</td>
      <td>Senate Democrats made a push Tuesday for their version of H.R.1, the House bill to seize control of election rules nationwide. How they imagine they have any mandate for this is a mystery. In a Senate divided 50-50, Democrats don’t even have the committee votes to amend their own bill.<br />At Tuesday’s session of the Senate Rules Committee, the two sides took turns offering revisions that, with minor exceptions, failed 9-9. GOP Leader Mitch McConnell knocked Democrats for trying “to hot-wire our democracy itself without a single vote from the other side.” Another worry: The constitutionally dubious parts of H.R.1 make it a time bomb for the 2022 midterms.<br />The bill has broad mandates that ostensibly apply only to federal elections. States would be forced to offer no-excuses mail ballots. They’d have to count votes straggling in 10 days late, provided the postmarks were stamped Election Day. They’d have to set up same-day registration and couldn’t withhold ballots from felons, except those imprisoned.<br />Where does Congress get the power to make such rules? As 20 state attorneys general said in a March letter, the Constitution grants Congress the authority to set “the Time of chusing the Electors.” But specifying the “Manner” is for state legislatures. For presidential elections, see you in court, H.R.1.<br />For other federal races, H.R.1 has more leeway: The Constitution lets state lawmakers set rules for electing Senators and Representatives, but “Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.” A legal problem here is that H.R.1’s mandates are so detailed that they can’t help impinging on state elections for Governor, Attorney General and so forth.</td>

That debate is coming to a head Wednesday, when House GOP lawmakers are expected to vote to remove Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) from her post as the No. 3 Republican in leadership.<br />Oren Cass, executive director of the conservative think tank American Compass and Mitt Romney’s former policy adviser, on Tuesday likened Mr. Trump to an earthquake that exposed “what was poorly built or outdated” but also presented an “opportunity to rebuild.”<br />Mr. Cass added that the GOP’s tensions aren’t just about personality but also about whether the party should think more intentionally about how the economy is divided by class.<br />“All of these debates get tangled up in the more personality-driven component. I think when you strip that out, you still find the conceptual debates there,” he said of the party, arguing that the gaps between middle-class Americans and so-called elites deserved attention from conservatives. “The reality is, we’re going to have to resolve those, if conservatism is going to move forward beyond Trump to actually provide a direction for the country.”</td>

      <td>A Labor Department survey rebuts their jobless benefit claims.</td>
      <td>White House economists say there’s no “measurable” evidence that the $300 federal unemployment bonus is discouraging unemployed people from seeking work. They were rebutted by Tuesday’s Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Jolts survey, which showed a record 8.1 million job openings in March.<br />That roughly equals the number that payroll employment is down from the February 2020 pre-pandemic peak. Job openings increased across the economy, but especially in food services and accommodation (185,000), state and local education (155,000) and arts and entertainment (81,000). Restaurants are reopening and expanding capacity as lockdowns lift and more people get vaccinated, so they need more workers. More schools are reopening, which means they need janitors, bus drivers and security officials.<br />But these jobs often pay less than what most workers could make on unemployment. That explains why the number of job openings in many industries increased more than the number of new hires in March. In leisure and hospitality, job openings increased by a whopping 267,000 but hires declined by 6,000. Hmmm. Job openings in state and local education grew by a sizeable 155,000—2.5 times as much as hires.<br />Overall job openings in March increased by about 600,000 while new hires ticked up a mere 200,000. The number of workers who quit their jobs also grew by 125,000. This is usually a sign of a strengthening labor market, but in this case some quitters may be leaving their jobs because they figure they can make more unemployed for the next six months after Democrats extended the bonus into September.<br />This week the governors of Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and South Carolina announced they will forego federal funding for the $300-a-week supplement to unemployment insurance, joining Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, who did so last week. Businesses will be grateful to have workers back, and so will their customers.</td>

      <td>Brown didn’t pose a threat during encounter shown in body- and dash-camera footage, lawyer says</td>
      <td>Family members of Andrew Brown Jr. said they believe his fatal shooting by police in northeastern North Carolina was akin to an execution, based on a private viewing Tuesday of six videos from police body and dashboard cameras.<br />Mr. Brown, a 42-year-old Black man, was shot five times outside his home on April 21 by Pasquotank County Sheriff’s Office deputies as they attempted to serve drug-related search and arrest warrants, authorities said. The Federal Bureau of Investigationhas opened a civil-rights investigation into the shooting.<br />Chance Lynch, a local lawyer representing the Brown family, said the videos showed Mr. Brown had been seated in a car in his driveway when the shooting began, then backed the car away to flee the officers. There were at least six bullet holes in the passenger-side window and one in the rear window, he said. There was no weapon visible, and after the shooting, deputies pulled Mr. Brown’s limp body from the car and placed it facedown on the ground, he said.<br />“At no point did we see Mr. Brown pose a threat to the law-enforcement officers,” Mr. Lynch said, describing the shooting as “unconstitutional and not justifiable.”<br />Sheriff Tommy Wooten II has placed three of the deputies who fired their weapons on administrative leave. In a video statement posted Tuesday on his Facebook page, Sheriff Wooten said he was committed to ensuring an outside, independent investigation and offered condolences to the family and support for his staff.</td>

      <td>Iran’s Palestinian ally reignites its conflict with the Jewish state.</td>
      <td>The jihadists of Hamas on Tuesday launched the biggest single-day rocket attack on the Jewish State in memory, with hundreds flying toward Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as well as the usual civilian targets in southern Israel. Israel struck back at 500 targets in Gaza, and this has the potential to become a larger conflict after a relatively long period of Mideast quiet.<br />The Hamas attacks come after days of Palestinian riots in Jerusalem, some prompted by long-running property disputes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Israeli courts ruled in favor of Jewish owners and against Palestinian leaseholders who claim rights to the property dating to Jordan’s occupation of East Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The case’s Supreme Court hearing was delayed.<br />Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the Palestinian West Bank region adjacent to Jerusalem, has been held up as a moderate negotiating partner for Israel. Yet his party fomented the Jerusalem violence, broadcasting that it “calls on everyone to raise the level of confrontation in the coming days and hours in the Palestinian lands,” according to Palestinian Media Watch.<br />The 85-year-old Mr. Abbas, who has headed the Palestinian Authority since 2005 without standing for re-election, may want to turn up the temperature to compensate for falling public confidence in his rule. He’s in competition with Hamas and even more extreme groups, which he shut out of power in the West Bank last month by postponing elections yet again. Hamas, which promises the destruction of Israel, one-upped Mr. Abbas’s riots by reigniting its military confrontation.<br />Regional politics are at work too. Hamas is funded and supplied by Iran, whose Supreme Leader last week praised “the pure blood of Resistance martyrs” in Palestine. The Biden Administration’s courtship of Iran in renewed nuclear negotiations has been met by Houthi escalation against Saudi Arabia and now Hamas escalation against Israel. The regime may think that the more its proxies clash with U.S. allies, the more eager the U.S. Administration will be to make concessions.</td>

      <td>China’s birth dearth is becoming more acute as its population ages.</td>
      <td>President Xi Jinping has made no secret of his ambition to make China the dominant global power of the 21st century. But the latest Chinese census reveals a major vulnerability: What if the Middle Kingdom doesn’t have enough young people?<br />After some delay China finally released its census results Tuesday. Though the population grew a little last year—to 1.412 billion in 2020 from 1.4 billion—the more salient fact is that its population continues to gray as Chinese women are having fewer babies. The proportion of people 60 or older increased to 18.7% of the population (from 13.3% in 2010), even as it recorded the lowest number of annual births (12 million) since 1961.<br />Beijing has seen this coming. In 2016 Chinese couples were allowed to have two children instead of one, reversing a policy in place for 35 years. Last month the People’s Bank of China recommended the government abandon its population control policies if it hopes to compete with America, but even that may be too late. Once fertility falls, the trend is hard to reverse no matter what incentives governments offer.<br />Many governments have tried, and some believe that Poland or Hungary (which now spends nearly 5% of its GDP to encourage its citizens to have more children) may have the answer. But generally these policies have either failed outright, or shown at best modest fertility gains.<br />The social and economic implications are enormous, involving everything from the dynamics of the Chinese family to the growing demands on China’s already stressed and underfunded health and pension programs. In March the government announced it will gradually raise the retirement age from 60 today, no doubt in expectation of these results. The retirement costs would be difficult in any country, but China hasn’t achieved broad prosperity beyond its coast and major cities.</td>

      <td>Occidental’s first-quarter results show long-term investors hope for returns—even if that is sometime in the distant future</td>
      <td>A commodity producer will always be sensitive to factors beyond its control, but few ride the waves more dramatically these days than  Occidental Petroleum .<br />After reporting unsurprising first-quarter results, its shares tumbled by almost 8% Tuesday—a much steeper decline than other U.S. producers experienced after a cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline left the largest fuel conduit in the country shut down. The stock-market reaction appears overdone given the short-term nature of the problem rather than a structural decline in U.S. crude oil demand.<br />More important to flag is the progress Occidental Petroleum has made since last year. Part of that can be seen in the shift in forecasts: A year ago, analysts expected the company to turn a net loss of $660 million for the first quarter of 2021. Its actual net loss came in at roughly half of that. The real standout was its strong free cash flow of $1.6 billion, the company’s highest quarterly free cash flow in a decade and about double analysts’ expectations a year ago.<br />The Permian and DJ Basin assets underlying Occidental’s ill-timed Anadarko Petroleum acquisition are finally starting to shine. Permian production came in at the high end of guidance, for example. Another standout was Occidental’s chemicals business, which was its second-largest source of pretax income. Strong construction-related polyvinyl chloride demand, driven by robust housing starts, is one factor behind that performance.<br />All of that will help Occidental slowly but steadily whittle away the enormous debt burden it took on for the Anadarko purchase. The company has stuck to its debt-reduction promises thus far, closing on the sale of roughly $500 million worth of assets last quarter and repaying $174 million of debt. Sector investors focused lately on cash returns will have to look elsewhere, though: It will be some time before the company can direct that free cash flow back to shareholders’ pockets. Its single focus at the moment is to whittle down its $30 billion-plus net debt load to the mid-$20 billion range.</td>

      <td>Yes, the Trump approach to China was chaotic. But out of it came innovations, including whole-of-government problem solving.</td>
      <td>A National Security Council memo to President Trump, drafted in late 2016, laid out the facts very clearly: “China’s aspiration is manifestly not to settle for a balance of power with the United States, [it is] to achieve hegemony over its neighbors and the Western Pacific.” Moreover, this “goal of hemispheric supremacy isn’t the whim of President Xi Jinping,” since 2012 the head of the Chinese Communist Party. “It stems from Party aspirations going back decades; Xi is merely accelerating the timeline.”<br />While a few foreign-policy experts had long been alarmed by the CCP’s bid for primacy, it took the advent of the Trump administration, unconstrained by the conventional wisdom of the Sinocracy, to get Washington to counter Mr. Xi’s stepped-up ambitions. Josh Rogin’s superbly researched “Chaos Under Heaven: Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century” is the first book-length dive into that newborn competition.<br />The book’s main theme is that, even with all of its serious downsides, Trumpian chaos and a relentless disregard for “how things are done” actually enabled his national-security policy team to innovate. One outcome of this creativity was a new whole-of-government approach that brought in Attorney General William Barr and FBI director Christopher Wray. Both led efforts to uncover a vast CCP network of political influence, espionage, and technology theft in the U.S.<br />Indeed, a new American focus on the CCP’s campaigns of internal subversion might be the Trump administration’s most enduring policy innovation. Alongside Beijing’s military modernization and oft-flexed diplomatic muscle, China has also been spreading its influence inside the U.S. and throughout the West to weaken resolve and co-opt elites. Mr. Rogin, a columnist for the Global Opinions section of the Washington Post, reports that China “hawks” on Team Trump enlisted foreign experts such as Australia’s John Garnaut, who had helped confront the CCP’s malign influence in his own country, to educate Washington about how to deal with similar threats.<br />In what could be the plot of a thriller, Mr. Rogin traces Washington’s efforts to engage the CCP threat. The FBI and the Department of Justice began criminal investigations and prosecutions of U.S.-based scientists recruited by China to collect sensitive information. Meanwhile, working with a network of American academics, the Trump administration confronted the CCP’s influence on U.S. college campuses. In turn, Beijing gave no quarter, trying (unsuccessfully) to intimidate then U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley into silence on the Uyghurs of Xinjiang and threatening U.S. businesses with sanctions if they supported Taiwan or Hong Kong.</td>

      <td>Jerusalem is a powder keg, but the shift of the focus to Gaza reduces the prospects of unity against Israel.</td>
      <td>Jerusalem<br />After distant explosions, the clear sky was suddenly covered with hundreds of birds, all flying east, away from the noise. It was a few minutes after 6 p.m. Monday. Hamas had just launched a volley of seven rockets from the Gaza Strip at this city, the moment of escalation in what has been a month of increasing violence, which began in Jerusalem and is now spreading across Israel.<br />The crowds at IDF Square downtown, participants in a march to celebrate Jerusalem Day, the anniversary of Israel’s conquest in the 1967 Six Day War, took shelter inside the nearest buildings. But after a few minutes people returned to the square, and the chanting and singing picked up again. A colleague covering the Palestinian protests at the Damascus Gate a few hundred yards away told me later that the demonstrators greeted the explosions with whistling and applause.<br />Jerusalem is carrying an excess of symbolic weight. The Old City, and specifically the hill Jews know as the Temple Mount and Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif, is at the center of the 150-year struggle between Jews and Arab Muslims for sovereignty west of the Jordan River. What conflict begins there rarely stays confined within the municipal boundaries. Israel is nevertheless some distance away from facing a new, broad uprising west of the Jordan. A third intifada seems unlikely.<br />Monday’s rocket salvo on Jerusalem kicked off a night of heavy fire from Hamas-controlled Gaza; the Israel Defense Force responded. Hamas has fired at least 630 rockets since. The IDF has hit at least 500 targets in the strip in retaliation. At the time I write this, rockets are still falling. There are dead and wounded on both sides.</td>

      <td>The lesson I learned as a girl—‘get back on the horse’—has never been more relevant.</td>
      <td>Charlottesville, Va.<br />At the Brookhill Farm stable here in the heart of “horse country,” I’m not surprised when the manager says there was a surge of new riders during Covid. People sought outdoor activities to relieve the stress of lockdown and found the joy and peace that riding these noble animals can bring.<br />It reminded me that America is a country that respects and cherishes horses deeply because of how they have shaped its history. Domestic horses were introduced into North America with the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, and escaped horses spread in the Great Plains. To this day, American ranchers tend their herds on horses—the origin of the unique form of riding known as the Western style, practiced by cowboys, a word I learned as a teenager in Italy.<br />I began riding as a girl and competed in show jumping. It’s a dangerous sport but a rewarding one. At first I fell a lot, even as I slowly gained confidence in my ability. Like all teens, I sometimes felt invincible, and riding taught me I wasn’t.<br />Once I was relaxing on my horse after a training session, without my stirrups and with long reins, and the animal bucked because another horse scared him. The next thing I knew, I was waking up in an ambulance with my father almost too insistently trying to rouse me. I woke up again with my hands tied to a hospital bed as a precautionary measure, and called the doctors to free me because I didn’t enjoy being tied down. I suffered a face and neck injury. When I went back to school I felt out of place. I couldn’t speak properly because my lip was broken and I wore a neck collar that made it difficult to study. I was riding again as soon as I was able.</td>

      <td>A book excerpt published by Bloomberg News purports to tell “The Untold Story of How Jeff Bezos Beat the Tabloids,” but it’s hard to see the triumph it’s talking about.<br />The just-released “Amazon Unbound,” by reporter Brad Stone, makes evident all over again that the National Enquirer was factual, truthful and well-sourced in everything it reported two years ago about the married Mr. Bezos’ affair with a married helicopter pilot.<br />Mr. Bezos lied outright or was extraordinarily disingenuous in the counternarrative he promoted, suggesting that because of his ownership of the Washington Post he was the victim of a political hit hatched by the Trump administration and/or Saudi Arabia. What soon became obvious at the time is even more obvious now. Mr. Bezos and his advisers had early indications the real source of the leak wasn’t Saudi Arabia bugging his phone. As the Journal reported, it was his girlfriend’s brother, a Hollywood press agent. Unmentioned even now is the obvious corollary. If Mr. Bezos didn’t share the couple’s intimate texts with the brother, he knew his paramour likely did.<br />We’ve all been there—remember the scene in “Arthur” when the dog is punished whenever the elderly housekeeper breaks wind. But Mr. Bezos’ perhaps reluctance to confront his girlfriend only underlines his consciousness of deception as he set out to promote an alternative narrative about Saudi phone hackers.<br />It all comes a cropper in Mr. Stone’s book just as it did for some of us in real time. The disingenuous, circumstantial case mounted by a hired consulting firm. A U.S. attorney’s investigation quietly dropped. The brother’s lame attempt, after the Enquirer exposed him as its source, to worm his way into the billionaire’s good graces by supporting the Saudi narrative. When the full exchange between his representatives and the tabloid are considered, the Enquirer apparently never tried to blackmail Mr. Bezos, as he alleged.</td>

      <td>Going easy on bad behavior makes life difficult for those students who are in school to get an education.</td>
      <td>What should take priority in K-12 education, the physical safety of students or racial balance in school suspension rates? Barack Obama and Donald Trump had different answers to that question, and it probably won’t surprise you where President Biden comes down.<br />In 2012, the Education Department released a study showing that black students were more likely than their white peers to be suspended and expelled from school. This disparity was taken as evidence of racial bias, and two years later the department issued threatening “guidance” letters to school districts across the country. The letters essentially warned that schools would face federal civil-rights investigations if black suspension rates didn’t come down. Schools were pressured to discipline students, or not, based on race rather than behavior, and many administrators and teachers obliged.<br />In New York, Los Angeles and Chicago—the nation’s three largest school systems—reductions in suspensions and expulsions were followed by an uptick in bullying and other disruptive behavior. Students and teachers alike have reported feeling less safe. Fighting, gang activity and drug use have increased. A 2018 study of schools in Wisconsin found that “softer discipline policies, pushed by the Obama administration, are having a negative impact on student test scores.”<br />The sad irony is that black students, in whose name this was done, were the ones most hurt by racial quotas in school discipline. A 2017 federal survey of school safety by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 25% of black students nationwide reported being bullied, the highest percentage of any racial or ethnic group.<br />To its credit, the Trump administration revoked these policies in 2018 under the direction of then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who understood the strong link between violent school settings and poor academic performance in a way that seems lost on progressives. Going easy on troublemakers makes life much more difficult for the kids who are in school to get an education.</td>

He urged against spending cuts to his department, which lost some funding last year and has faced calls for further reductions from some city lawmakers.<br />The NYPD’s proposed annual expense budget for the coming fiscal year is $5.44 billion, which is 5.5% of the city’s $98.56 billion overall proposed budget. There are currently 35,030 uniformed members and 15,646 civilian members of the department, according to the NYPD.<br />The current fiscal year’s budget allocates nearly $271 million in overtime for the department, according to Bernard O’Brien, a police budget analyst at the city’s Independent Budget Office. The NYPD already has exceeded that amount this year, Mr. O’Brien said.<br />A total of $837.5 million was spent on NYPD overtime last year, and an average of $740.4 million over the past five years.</td>

Whitmer and Daniel Eichinger, director of the state’s natural resources department, reminded the company the state had revoked a permit that allowed the Line 5 pipeline to run along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The governor has given the company until May 12 to shut the pipeline.<br />Michigan has said the pipeline poses an environmental risk and that any spill from it would threaten the Great Lakes. Enbridge has said that section of the 68-year-old pipeline has never leaked and that it is taking steps to protect the lakes after negotiating a plan with former Gov. Rick Snyder to encase the pipes in a tunnel below the lake bed.<br />Enbridge has refused the order, arguing in a lawsuit that Michigan doesn’t have the authority to close the line, which transports oil and natural gas liquids from Superior, Wis., to refineries in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario and Quebec.<br />“Enbridge’s continued occupation and use of State-owned bottomlands in the absence of a valid and effective easement constitutes an intentional trespass,” said the governor in her letter. She said the state would, if it wins in court, require the company to disgorge “all profits derived from its wrongful use of the State’s property” after the May 12 deadline.</td>

The Biden administration said Tuesday it had approved the project’s construction and operations plans for as many as 84 turbines 12 miles off Nantucket, saying it could be a major job creator and address climate change.<br />In a written statement, Vineyard Wind Chief Executive Lars Pedersen said federal approval “is not about the start of a single project, but the launch of a new industry.”<br />The project is planned to generate as many as 800 megawatts for Massachusetts ratepayers, enough to power 400,000 homes and businesses, the company and the Interior Department said. U.S. approval was needed because the project is in federal waters.<br />Vineyard Wind was just the first of roughly 10 offshore projects waiting for permit reviews at the Interior Department as investors seek to meet growing demand for zero-emissions energy.</td>

Doug Ducey swiftly signed the new measure shortly after it passed the Senate Tuesday, saying it is about election integrity. “Not a single Arizona voter will lose their right to vote as a result of this new law,” Mr. Ducey said upon signing the legislation.<br />Democrats oppose the bill, but Republicans control both legislative chambers in Arizona by narrow margins. GOP lawmakers say creating a new mechanism to remove names from what has been known as the permanent early voting list will help keep the list up-to-date, accounting for things like deaths and people moving out of state.<br />The measure would stop ballots being automatically mailed to voters if they don’t vote on an early ballot in two consecutive election cycles. Proponents of the new law said the voters would remain registered to vote and would be warned before being pulled from the list.<br />“We’re not going to back down from something that’s reasonable, that is common sense and protects the integrity of our elections,” said Republican state Sen.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also called for an end to the bonus.<br />“Federal pandemic-related unemployment benefit programs initially provided displaced Iowans with crucial assistance when the pandemic began,” Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a statement that called for the pandemic-related benefit to end June 12. “But now that our businesses and schools have reopened, these payments are discouraging people from returning to work.”<br />President Biden on Monday defended the enhanced benefits and said his administration would make clear that people can’t turn down suitable jobs and keep collecting benefits, except in specific circumstances. His Democratic administration has said that other factors are keeping workers on the sidelines, such as fear of getting sick during the pandemic and a lack of full-time child care.<br />“We’re not seeing this as the root cause, driver of people not seeking work,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday. “Of course, we’re going to see anecdotal examples—we certainly recognize that.”</td>

      <td>The six-part documentary tells the story of LGBTQ+ civil rights in America through intimate stories.</td>
      <td>Assumptions will be made in advance about “Pride,” the ambitious six-part documentary about the history of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLGBTQ+ civil rights in America. And some will be correct. Is it celebratory? Yes. Is it self-congratulatory? To a degree. Is it a sweeping, encyclopedic, overly ambitious, Ken Burns-ian attempt to be the last word on the subject? On the contrary.<br />Despite the breadth of the subject and the decades-long arc of the project—from “1950s: People Had Parties” through “2000s: Y2Gay”—the governing impulse in the series is for intimacy, a telling of smaller personal stories that illuminate the large themes. The anecdotal aside (or digression) is a stratagem employed by plenty of documentaries, as well as political speeches. But here it provides warmth and a pulse to what might have in other hands been deadly dull historiography. “Pride” is very much alive, partly because it goes deep rather than wide in wrangling the unwieldy, unmanageable stories that make up an equally untidy movement.<br />Each episode of “Pride”—which will be available on Hulu the day after it makes its premiere on FX (three episodes Friday; three more, May 21)—is the work of a different director or directors, all of whom come out of what’s generally lumped together as gay or queer cinema. Each filmmaker imposes personal stylistic choices on the tale of his/her/their decade, but they also operate in rather specific neighborhoods of the LGBTQ+ community, with intersections. Cheryl Dunye’s chapter on the ’70s, for instance, begins with the lives of the filmmaker Barbara Hammer and the poet Audre Lorde and eventually gets into the intramural wars of the women’s movement, whose leaders (notably Betty Friedan) resisted gay involvement for fear of alienating mainstream America. Which was something the Christian Right and Phyllis Schlafly would exploit, as Ms. Dunye goes on to explain.<br />This echoes, in its way, the approach of Bayard Rustin, a major strategist for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who, as recalled in Andrew Ahn’s “1960s: Riots & Revolutions,” understood not just the moral weight of nonviolence but its usefulness in swaying public opinion. Similarly, he and the Black civil rights movement understood the need to play down Rustin’s involvement and his own homosexuality.<br />One of the recurring conflicts within “Pride” is between pragmatism and radicalism, of movements at war with themselves—“1980s: Underground,” directed by Anthony Caronna and Alex Smith, is one example, dealing as it does with the AIDS crisis. But the history is one thing, the storytelling another. “Pride,” co-produced with Killer Films (whose Christine Vachon has been a force in gay-oriented cinema for decades), doesn’t try to do the impossible, to be all things to all people LGBTQ+. There are some things lost in such a filmmaking philosophy, of course. But most of them are boring. What was gained was something sincerely moving and even more valuable than a cataloging of legislative malpractices, or a parade of well-known people.</td>

      <td>The new comedy from Regina Y. Hicks and Wanda Sykes feels dated, clumsy and oh-so-not funny.</td>
      <td>To say that “The Upshaws” is stuck in the ’70s doesn’t quite do it. The 1970s? Or the 1870s? Created by writer Regina Y. Hicks and the comedian Wanda Sykes, the show boasts production values that might easily have cost more than, say, $14.75. The laugh track is like your neighbor’s broken car alarm. The aesthetics evoke the era of “Good Times” or “All in the Family,” although the social messaging is absent—in fact, the jokes are entrenched in racial stereotyping and clichés. “The Upshaws” was meant to be transgressive, one imagines. It’s harder to imagine who’ll be laughing.<br />While it has something of a female point of view, this Netflix series is built around Bennie (Mike Epps), who runs an auto garage in Indianapolis, where he lives with his long-suffering wife, Regina (Kim Fields), and their two grade-school-age daughters, Aaliyah and Maya (Khali Daniya-Renee Spraggins, Journey Christine). He has an adult son, Bernard (Jermelle Simon), from a long-ago relationship and an adolescent one from a more recent dalliance: Kelvin (Diamond Lyons) is the son of Bennie and Tasha (Gabrielle Dennis), who got together with Bennie while he and Regina were on a “break”—one that Regina doesn’t remember in quite the same way. “I gotta be there for my three kids,” Bennie says during a rare moment of introspection. “You have four,” he’s reminded. Cue the laugh track.<br />Almost every TV comedy series has a running gag, a founding joke. Homer Simpson’s stupidity, for instance, or the “South Park” kids’ precocious vulgarity. In “The Upshaws” the basis of the humor is Bennie’s moral irresponsibility. Or, at least, his predisposition toward moral irresponsibility. Ms. Sykes, as Bennie’s acerbic sister-in-law, Lucretia, gets a lot of mileage out of it, upbraiding him for every misstep, which not only provides a showcase for her particular brand of takedown comedy but keeps her busy. Bennie is, after all, a reprobate. When Tasha, dropping off Kelvin, informs the boy’s father that he’s been suspended for stealing a teacher’s wallet, Bennie is shocked: “Didn’t I tell you teachers ain’t got no money?” he asks. Sex preoccupies Bennie to the extent that the subject invades many conversations, no matter who’s in the room (including his daughters). As Regina, Ms. Fields seesaws between disgruntlement and outrage, with plenty of provocation.<br />In the opening episode, Bennie is planning a trip to Las Vegas on the weekend of Aaliyah’s birthday, and is supposed to have rented a space for her party—which is also falling on the same day as Kelvin’s birthday party. Since Bennie has done nothing that he’s supposed to have done, we’re treated to the kind of tiresome sitcom devices that were old when Lucy was married to Ricky. He lies to Regina, he scrambles to find a space, he still wants to go to Vegas. He’s finally bailed out by his friend and new employee, Duck (Page Kennedy, the show’s one revelation and a major asset), who is supposed to be having a welcome-home-from-prison party but has found Jesus: In a gesture of Christian charity, he surrenders the VFW hall to Bennie. Unfortunately, the space has already been decorated like a topless bar, replete with stripper poles. All of which delights Aaliyah. She may be alone.</td>

      <td>Pairing spoken-word segments about positive change with music; a longform celebration of George Washington Carver.</td>
      <td><br />Two exceptional new jazz recordings by veteran saxophonists—Ted Nash and James Brandon Lewis—carry an uplifting message along with their music.<br />On “Transformation: Personal Stories of Change, Acceptance and Evolution” (Tiger Turn), Mr. Nash joins with Glenn Close and members of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra on a series of pieces that integrate spoken word and lushly arranged instrumental segments. The actress, who is a frequent collaborator with Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Mr. Nash, who has been involved with the organization for more than 20 years, previously worked together on his 2016 recording “Presidential Suite, Eight Variations on Freedom” (Motéma), which combined music with excerpts of speeches by American presidents and other world leaders. Ms. Close read the words of Myanmar Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on that Grammy-winning recording.<br />For the new project, Ms. Close curated the spoken segments, with a theme of positive change, and Mr. Nash conducted a 15-member band. The works on “Transformation” range from the poet Ted Hughes’s “Tales From Ovid” to a letter in which Mr. Nash’s son comes out as transgender. In addition to Ms. Close, the readers include Wayne Brady and Amy Irving.<br />The 77-minute program begins with “Creation Part I,” featuring Mr. Brady and Ms. Close trading verses of Mr. Hughes’s poem, backed by puckish unisons from trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and saxophonist Sherman Irby, elevating the words into an urgent narrative. This is followed by “Creation Part II,” which is entirely instrumental, highlighted by a poignant baritone saxophone solo by Paul Nedzela. This pair of tracks sets the template for much of the recording: Words backed by music raise tension, and entirely instrumental passages resolve it. This pattern can be heard not only in consecutive tracks, but sometimes in a single work—as in “Rising Out of Hatred,” where Matthew Stevenson, an observant Jew, recounts meeting Derek Black, a white nationalist, in college and the effects of their friendship. The serene harmonies and muted trumpet of Tatum Greenblatt anticipate the neo-Nazi renouncing his philosophy after attending Shabbat dinners and their playing music together. The recording closes with “Reaching the Tropopause,” from Tony Kushner’s “Angels in America,” with recitations by Mr. Brady and Ms. Close; rousing, sweeping orchestrations from Mr. Nash; and stellar, intricate solos from Mr. Marsalis and saxophonist Victor Goines.</td>

      <td>Monarch formally opens Parliament in ceremony pared down because of Covid-19</td>
      <td>LONDON—Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday undertook her first major public engagement since the funeral of her husband, Prince Philip, announcing her government’s legislative agenda during a pared-back ceremony in Britain’s Parliament.<br />The queen, wearing a light blue hat and day dress instead of the traditional robes and a crown, sat alone in the House of Lords, with the consort’s gilded chair removed for the first time in over a century as she opened Parliament. Prince Philip, the country’s longest-standing royal consort, died last month aged 99.<br />During a ceremony adapted to meet Covid-19 guidelines, ermine-clad members of the House of Lords sat socially distanced in the country’s upper house. The 95-year-old monarch read out a speech that laid out the legislation Boris Johnson’s government intends to put before Parliament.<br />At recent state openings of Parliament, the queen’s eldest son, Prince Charles, sat by her side, as he has done since Prince Philip retired from public duties in 2017. But during this ceremony Prince Charles and his wife sat on chairs off to the side of the stage. The queen traveled to the venue by car rather than by horse and coach.<br />She didn’t wear the Imperial State Crown, a heavy piece of jewelry encrusted with nearly 3,000 precious stones, which instead lay on a pillow by her side as she delivered the speech written for her by the government.</td>

      <td>Digital startup would merge with Aurora Acquisition and raise nearly $800 million in new capital</td>
      <td>Startup mortgage lender Better, whose valuation has swelled in the private markets, said Tuesday that it plans to go public by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company.<br />Better Holdco Inc., which operates a digital platform for mortgages and related services, plans to merge with  Aurora Acquisition Corp. , a SPAC sponsored by the investment firm Novator Capital, the companies said. The deal, reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal, values Better at roughly $6.9 billion pre-new money, up from $4 billion late last year.<br />SoftBank Group Corp. , which recently invested $500 million in Better as part of a deal making sprint, could put in an additional $1.3 billion through what is known as a PIPE, or private investment in public equity, a common feature of SPAC mergers. (Better could place $400 million of that with other investors.) The remaining $200 million of the $1.5 billion PIPE is to come from Aurora, whose sponsor is the investment vehicle of Icelandic billionaire Thor Bjorgolfsson.<br />Better would raise nearly $800 million in new capital in the deal, with an additional roughly $950 million in proceeds going to cash out existing shareholders. As part of the transaction, customers who previously took out a mortgage from Better would be able to buy stock in the company through a direct share-purchase program. Better’s co-founder and chief executive, Vishal Garg, wouldn’t sell shares in the offering.<br />The rush among city dwellers to buy bigger homes in the suburbs during the pandemic, plus a surge in mortgage refinancing at historically low interest rates, contributed to a near-quintupling of Better’s loan volume last year, to $24 billion. The company’s management expects the new funds to help accelerate its move into related services, including home and title insurance.</td>

A field of 10 will contest the second leg of the Triple Crown at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.</td>

In 89% of those metro areas, median prices rose by more than 10% from a year earlier.<br />This week’s price data was the latest confirmation that the pandemic continues to reshape how and where many Americans want to live. Remote work prompted buyers to seek out more space, while pandemic-related restrictions made vacation houses more desirable, real-estate agents said.<br />The home-sales boom has been unusually widespread, with low mortgage rates fueling strong buyer interest across the U.S., especially for high-end properties.<br />But first-time buyers in particular have struggled to keep up with soaring prices, and those with limited budgets are often losing out to cash buyers. The length of time U.S. homeowners stay put, meanwhile, has been steadily rising. Some have decided not to move, or they postponed selling because of concerns about letting buyers into their homes during a pandemic.</td>

      <td>Unlike traditional plastics sourced from nonrenewable fossil fuels, PHA is sourced from renewable natural ingredients.</td>
      <td>“Claim of Ocean-Safe Plastic Seen as Inflated” (Technology, March 22) raises questions about the marketing of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a biodegradable alternative to traditional petrochemical plastic. Drinking straws made with PHA are already in use, and other single-use products are far along in development with major customer brands. Unlike traditional plastics sourced from nonrenewable fossil fuels, PHA is sourced from renewable natural ingredients.<br />Because PHA is a naturally occurring substance, it will return to nature upon disposal. Decades of research have verified that PHA will naturally aerobically degrade when bacteria are present, such as within soil, freshwater and marine environments, as well as in a variety of waste-treatment facilities, including anaerobic digesters, industrial composters and certain types of landfills designed for biodegradation. In landfills that are sealed to prevent biodegradation, PHA is sequestered into the ground as carbon.<br />TÜV Austria, one of the most widely accepted international standards for biodegradability, has certified Danimer Scientific’s Nodax PHA as a material that will reliably degrade in conditions ranging from industrial composting to marine environments. While the timeframe for complete degradation varies depending on real-world settings—including the dimensions, form and application of the material—PHA will break down in months into natural elements, unlike petrochemical plastic that can take centuries to degrade and leaves harmful microplastics behind.<br />PHA is a proven safeguard for ensuring single-use items and containers will biodegrade, even if they escape proper waste-management streams and end up in the environment. This reliability has led brands such as PepsiCo, Bacardi, Nestle and Mars Wrigley to invest in PHA for their product lines. We seek to help solve the problem of global plastic waste.<br />Stephen Croskrey</td>

Henderson (“Youth Pay a High Price for Covid Protection,” op-ed, May 4), it can be added that such considerations were discussed in the 1760s, during the Enlightenment smallpox-inoculation debate. Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli and French scientist and man of letters Jean le Rond d’Alembert calculated and argued about the comparative life-expectancy risk and reward of being inoculated versus doing without. Both regretted the absence of age-specific mortality data for smallpox victims. Bernoulli thought existing statistics compelling enough to urge inoculation for all; d’Alembert advised waiting until fuller data became available. Today, for a different health crisis, we have such data and vastly better means of immunization, which, if used intelligently, make policy-formation easier.<br />But d’Alembert also reminds us that in policy-making we cannot escape a troubling moral dilemma. The state’s and individuals’ interests are too easily confounded. He said: The state considers its citizens “indifferently” and en masse, whereas “for each individual, the interest of self-preservation comes first.”<br />David Spadafora<br />Pinehurst, N.C.</td>

The vice president of finance for Whalen Corp. said he doesn’t have alternative ways of getting gas or any sense for when his supply might be replenished.

At the same hearing, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Democrats were pursuing the voting legislation in Congress in a way that would reduce Americans’ confidence in the accuracy and fairness of elections, such as by removing voter ID requirements.<br />“Why are Democrats so hell bent on doing whatever it takes to rewire our democracy on a thoroughly partisan basis?” Mr. McConnell asked.</td>

      <td>The U.S. Treasury Department last month kicked off the process of establishing a long-awaited corporate ownership registry. The agency is already facing sharply diverging views on how it should work.<br />Top of mind for financial institutions and other stakeholders is how ownership information that is submitted to the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network will be collected and verified, and who will have access to it.<br />The registry, which experts say could be years in the making, is supposed to help the U.S. crack down on the illicit use of anonymous shell companies. Congress outlined the parameters for the new database in a law passed in January, but it falls on FinCEN to work out the specifics. That includes defining who qualifies as an owner and which companies will be exempt from submitting information.<br />The first step is to write the regulations that will govern the database, a task FinCEN is supposed to complete by January. As part of that process, the agency has received more than 200 letters following an April request for input about those proposed regulations. It will have another two years to put the regulations it writes into effect.<br />A FinCEN spokeswoman said the agency is reviewing the comments it received.</td>

But now the wolf actually may have arrived.<br />He is asking for a fatter paycheck.<br />The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the number of unfilled job openings in the U.S. rose to a record 8.1 million on the last day of March, lifting the job-openings rate—job openings as a percentage of the total number of open and filled jobs—to 5.3% from 5% a month earlier. Before the pandemic, the highest the job-openings rate had ever hit in the 20-year history of the data was 4.8% in 2018.<br />If anything, the job-openings rate is higher now. Data from jobs site Indeed.com show that as of May 7 job postings were a seasonally adjusted 23% above their Feb. 1, 2020, level. That is up from the end of March, when postings were 16% above that pre-pandemic level.<br />Stories about businesses struggling to find workers were a constant feature of the years leading up to the pandemic, but since wage gains were middling throughout that period, they began drawing scoffs.

      <td>Key margins for mortgage lenders are dropping. But originators like Rocket and UWM may emerge with bigger slices of the pie in what could still be a solid market.</td>
      <td>The dynamics of the mortgage business are playing out at high speed. It might not always be fun to watch, but investors shouldn’t turn away yet.<br />It has long been known that high margins in the mortgage business spur intense competition, especially when rising rates crimp some demand for refinancing. So with profitability for mortgage originators surging to incredible levels last year, it is no surprise that the reaction this year is also fierce.<br />For the first quarter, originators such as Rocket Cos. and UWM Holdings reported drops in a key measure of what they earn when originating and selling mortgages, called gain-on-sale margins. Those margins reflect both market spreads and pricing decisions by originators. Rocket and UWM guided to levels even lower in the coming quarter. Investors seem to have been surprised by the pace of this trend: Stocks of both companies are down more than 15% so far in May.<br />These margins do have some context. Rocket expects its overall gain-on-sale margin to fall from around 3.7% in the first quarter to under 3%, with the margin on loans originated with partners, like brokers, to be around 1%. UWM, which is entirely focused on brokers, guided that its first-quarter margin of about 2.2% could fall to 1.1% or below. Those are still levels high enough for firms to be profitable and aren’t anything new to brokers accustomed to prior cycles. Gain-on-sale margins also tend to stabilize after hitting lows.<br />So for now, a really key measure will be volume—both from an overall market point of view and whether attractive pricing to partners like brokers will help the firms pick up share as they outlast competitors with weaker balance sheets and less efficient cost bases.</td>

      <td>The International Energy Agency exposes the hidden environmental costs and infeasibility of going green.</td>
      <td>The International Energy Agency, the world’s pre-eminent source of energy information for governments, has entered the political debate over whether the U.S. should spend trillions of dollars to accelerate the energy transition favored by the Biden administration. You know, the plan to use far more “clean energy” and far less hydrocarbons—the oil, natural gas and coal that today supply 84% of global energy needs. The IEA’s 287-page report released this month, “The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions,” is devastating to those ambitions. A better title would have been: “Clean Energy Transitions: Not Soon, Not Easy and Not Clean.”<br />The IEA assembled a large body of data about a central, and until now largely ignored, aspect of the energy transition: It requires mining industries and infrastructure that don’t exist. Wind, solar and battery technologies are built from an array of “energy transition minerals,” or ETMs, that must be mined and processed. The IEA finds that with a global energy transition like the one President Biden envisions, demand for key minerals such as lithium, graphite, nickel and rare-earth metals would explode, rising by 4,200%, 2,500%, 1,900% and 700%, respectively, by 2040.<br />The world doesn’t have the capacity to meet such demand. As the IEA observes, albeit in cautious bureaucratese, there are no plans to fund and build the necessary mines and refineries. The supply of ETMs is entirely aspirational. And if it were pursued at the quantities dictated by the goals of the energy transition, the world would face daunting environmental, economic and social challenges, along with geopolitical risks.<br />The IEA stipulates up front one underlying fact that advocates of a transition never mention: Green-energy machines use far more critical minerals than conventional-energy machines do. “A typical electric car requires six times the mineral inputs of a conventional car, and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more mineral resources than a gas-fired power plant,” the report says. “Since 2010, the average amount of minerals needed for a new unit of power generation capacity has increased by 50% as the share of renewables has risen.” That was merely to bring wind and solar to a 10% share of the world’s electricity.<br />As the IEA notes dryly, the transition is a “shift from a fuel-intensive to a material-intensive energy system.” That means a shift away from liquids and gases whose extraction and transport leave a very light footprint on the land and are transported easily, cheaply and efficiently, and toward big-footprint mines, the energy-intensive transport of massive amounts of rocks and other solid materials, and subsequent chemical processing and refining.</td>

      <td>Cultural or economic differences needn’t preclude a bipartisan child allowance.</td>
      <td>There’s a bipartisan consensus that families with children need help. It emerged during Donald Trump’s presidency as concerns about the federal budget deficit faded. But the issue has taken on fresh urgency with the pandemic’s hit to the economy.<br />The economic downturn has hit women harder than men, unlike past recessions. Labor-force participation has dropped across the board since the pandemic started, but women with children have been especially slow to return to the workforce. Women without children have returned in greater numbers. Men with children lead all other groups; more married women than married men are staying home to take care of their children.<br />The reasons for this disparity are complicated; some are in dispute. Many who hold more-traditional views say women choose to work less and spend more time rearing children. Progressives counter that unfair gender stereotypes are to blame. Many economists argue that this is a rational calculation since men still earn more than women. One thing is clear: As long as schools and child-care centers stay closed, women will face intense pressures.<br />As schools reopen, some of this pressure should lift. But deeper problems will linger. American women’s labor-force participation peaked in 2000 at 60.3% and then fell steadily. In January 2020, right before the pandemic, it stood at 57.8%. America used to lead most advanced economies in women’s labor-force participation; the U.S. is now behind all the other English-speaking countries and most members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.<br />It is possible that U.S. women’s preferences have changed enough to account for this decline. But the rising cost of child care compared with women’s wages is a more plausible explanation. The Biden administration has proposed a partnership with the states to offer free pre-K to all 3- and 4-year-olds. The administration also proposes subsidizing child care for children under 5 by limiting some out-of-pocket costs to 7% of family income.</td>

The WHO’s scientists didn’t report any evidence that vaccines aren’t effective against the new variant.<br />India is in the process of ramping up its capacity to do genomic sequencing to track changes in the virus’s genetic makeup by examining positive test samples. Yet the effort in India, which is dealing with the world’s worst current Covid-19 outbreak, is a fraction of the scale of the genomic sequencing being done in the U.K.<br />On Tuesday, the Indian government reported 3,876 more deaths over the past 24 hours, taking the toll to nearly 250,000 deaths, with nearly 330,000 new cases added daily. The case count had climbed as high as 400,000 in recent days.<br />Ten laboratories in India are working on the sequencing, with a combined capacity of processing 1,000 samples a day. “The labs have done a fantastic job to rise to the challenge,” said Shahid Jameel, a virologist who is head of the scientific advisory committee for India’s national sequencing effort.</td>

The pipeline’s operator, Colonial Pipeline Co., now says that service could be offline until the end of the week, threatening to raise prices at the pump for millions of Americans.<br />Attacks are growing in number and scale as millions of people around the country work or attend school remotely, in some cases opening back doors to networks without corporate or institutional security protections, security researchers say.<br />Hackers have grown adept at communicating about vulnerabilities on the so-called Dark Web, a network of computers that can share information anonymously. The ability to demand payment in cryptocurrency limits law-enforcement tracking capabilities. And the growth in insurance policies that cover ransomware payments has helped seed an increasingly professionalized ransomware industry.<br />Senior officials in the Biden administration have said ransomware is likely the most serious cybersecurity threat to the U.S. and that on its current trajectory the problem will only get worse in the years ahead.

      <td>Name another fund manager that sells “Invest In The Future” onesies and “Analyst” hoodies on its website.<br />Just as unusual as ARK Invest’s marketing has been its performance, growing its assets more quickly than any active exchange-traded fund firm in history. undefinedCathie Wood’s firm went from about $3.5 billion under management across several funds shortly before the pandemic struck to hit the $50 billion mark a year later. But that rapid growth has come back to bite her investors.<br />Even after a major tumble the past few months, the actual damage isn’t obvious from a longer-term look at her funds’ performance charts. So many investors piled in relatively recently, though, that her actual wealth-creation record is unimpressive. Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group calculate that the money-weighted annualized return of her funds since inception was 5.24% through Monday. That is far less than a steady investment in a plain vanilla S&P 500 index fund.<br />And ARK Invest’s paper gains have depended on some uncomfortably concentrated positions. There are big, liquid bets such as  Tesla ,  of course, but also smaller companies like  Intellia Therapeutics —which had just $58 million of sales last year—that could get hit hard if ARK begins to unload a lot of shares as investor cash leaves the funds. ARK funds owned 16.52% of the company at the end of 2020, more than any other institution by far, according to FactSet. Intellia rallied by 470% from the beginning of 2020 to its peak this January but has since retreated by 27%, giving it a current market cap of around $4.3 billion. Another stock with a similar pattern and ownership is  Crispr Therapeutics .<br />Ms. Wood’s “disruptive innovation” jargon may be somewhat novel. What her investors are experiencing isn’t. Fund managers like Gerald Tsai in the 1960s who rode Polaroid and Xerox to stardom or various dot-com visionaries in the late 1990s wound up doing poorly for clients who discovered them after they became hotshots. The culprit is unrealistic expectations and reversion to the mean for the bubbly sectors that got them there. Analyst Meb Faber points out that not one of the five Morningstar “fund managers of the decade” through 2010 even managed to beat the market in the next 10 years. The best of the bunch, Bruce Berkowitz’s Fairholme Fund, became the worst.</td>

      <td>Food writer Alexander Lobrano first visited Europe in the 1970s on a summer vacation with his mother. She wanted him to learn about the Roman Empire. He wanted to eat.</td>
      <td>THE SUMMER of 1972, my mother gave me the world. After receiving her inheritance from my Bostonian grandmother, she announced that we’d spend July and August in Europe. Leaving my father and sister, the baby of the family, behind in Westport, Conn., she would take me, then 14, and my two younger brothers to the Continent for the first month. Then we’d meet Dad and my sister in Paris and spend three weeks together touring France and the United Kingdom.<br />We started in Rome. “It’s important for you to see the great cities of Europe and know the ways of the world,” my mother mused aloud during dinner on our first night in the Piazza Navona. In the weeks that followed, her uncharacteristic extravagance astonished us. In Venice, we stayed at a luxurious hotel with rooms overlooking the Grand Canal. In Vienna, we had soufflé Rothschilds decorated with gold leaf for dessert in the opulent red dining room of the Hotel Sacher. On many mornings, breakfast arrived on rolling tables with crisp linen skirts, roses in crystal bud vases, baskets of powdered-sugar-sprinkled pastries and tiny jars of jam. She leavened indulgence with responsibility, putting me, for instance, in charge of tipping and insisting I make the dinner reservations. “But how? I don’t know any restaurants in Florence,” I implored. “Read guidebooks, ask local people, speak with the concierge,” she instructed.<br />She had designed a classic, art-rich itinerary of the great museums, monuments and churches of Europe but with a guiding theme, the Roman Empire, which was intended to pique our interest in the past by making it real. So we marched around the Colosseum and Pompeii in Italy, the ruins of Carnuntum in Austria, the Lindenhof Park in Zurich, and more in France and England. Noticing I was more enthusiastic about carbonara than Caravaggio, my mother occasionally attempted to reorder my priorities. “Food is an ephemeral pleasure, great art isn’t,” she had said when I’d insisted that the riso con carciofi (rice with artichokes) at lunch beat Attila the Hun’s stone throne as a persuasive reason to visit the island of Torcello in the Venetian lagoon.<br />Beyond the daily dose of art, my mother repeatedly taught us that generosity and amiability were vital traits of any good traveler. On an early morning train from Cologne to Paris, we shared a compartment with an old woman from Bratislava who took repeated swigs from the round bottle she kept in her handbag. Seeing my mother rub her eyes, she offered her a sip, which my mother gently declined. After pulling into Gare de Lyon, my brothers and I waited in the hot taxi while my mother helped the lady from Bratislava get her next train to Nîmes. “Why did you have to do that?” I complained when she returned. “That’s an awful question,” she said. “When you become a traveler, you help those who need you in the same way you hope others will help you.”<br />In Paris, I finally got to test a theory I’d formed as a 9-year-old while obsessively reading a book about the lives of a French brother and sister. The author’s lush descriptions of their meals, including cheese souffles and chocolate mousse, led me to conclude that France was a country where everything was delicious. Very quickly, this turned out to be true: The croque monsieur I devoured when we lunched in a cafe was the most amazing sandwich I’d ever had, what with the blistered cheese hiding a lubricious layer of Bechamel sauce on top of a slice of ham. On a walk that afternoon, I ended up glued to the windows of the cheese and pastry shops.</td>

President Biden also met virtually with a group of governors Tuesday afternoon to discuss vaccination efforts.<br />The administration will provide data on about 80,000 vaccination sites to Lyft and Uber as part of the transportation partnership, a senior administration official said.<br />While the companies were already providing free or discounted rides in some circumstances, the rides will now be free to anyone in the U.S. who is going to a vaccination site to get the shot, and Lyft and Uber will promote the rides to and from tens of thousands of vaccination sites through their apps. The feature will launch in the next two weeks and run until July 4, when Mr. Biden has aimed to have enough people vaccinated to allow for safer Independence Day gatherings.<br />The actions come as demand for vaccines has declined in recent weeks, prompting the administration to shift its allocation method to states as governments and private companies explore ways to incentivize people to get vaccinated.</td>

Ericsson shares were down nearly 4% Tuesday, trading slightly lower than its peers amid a broadly lower tech market.<br />The warning in the Chinese media is the latest example of Beijing using the heft of its domestic market to protect its business and foreign-policy interests.

At the same time, mortgage interest rates hit historic lows.<br />Suburban areas such as Suffolk County, N.Y., on Long Island, saw an inflow of big-city dwellers last year. Households arriving there from large metropolitan areas increased by 70%. Of all the change-of-address forms, 46% indicated they were coming from four New York City counties—those covering Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. The previous year, a third of all newcomers came from those counties.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is bracing for a showdown with Russia over the delivery of United Nations aid to millions of Syrians outside the control of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a flow that Moscow is poised to block in July.<br />At stake is the U.N.’s use of the Bab al-Hawa border crossing between Syria and Turkey, which the world body has used to send about 1,000 truckloads of aid a month to a region in northwest Syria with a population of more than four million.<br />The U.S. and its allies say the closure of the border to the U.N. would put civilians in jeopardy, especially the 2.7 million people in the area who have been displaced by the conflict. The U.N. also has just started its Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the area, an effort not easily replaced by another organization.<br />Moscow says, however, that the crossing is a violation of the Syrian government’s sovereignty and that assistance should be delivered from areas controlled by the regime, which has gained the upper hand against the opposition with the help of Russia and Iran after a decade of civil war.<br />“It’s clear that the stakes are quite high,” said a U.S. official at the U.N. “We’ll be actively engaged both with like-minded countries who are standing with us on this and with others who have expressed some skepticism.”</td>

      <td>Writing a novel can provide escapism, control and a dash of positive publicity for politicos like Abrams and Clinton, who this year join Newt Gingrich, Jimmy Carter and other politician-novelists.</td>
      <td>Last year was a banner time for political nonfiction, from a plethora of books about Donald Trump to Barack Obama’s latest bestselling memoir, A Promised Land. But a different sort of trend is making a comeback in 2021: Big-name politicians are writing fiction.<br />Stacey Abrams’s While Justice Sleeps, which centers on Avery Keene, a law clerk for a U.S. Supreme Court justice, is out May 11. After the justice falls into a coma, Keene must unravel a high-level conspiracy. (The former Georgia gubernatorial candidate has also written eight romance titles under the pen name Selena Montgomery.) On June 7, former President Bill Clinton teams up again with author James Patterson for The President’s Daughter, in which a former president, who had served as a Navy SEAL, embarks on a one-man mission to save his kidnapped teenager. (The pair’s 2018 novel, The President Is Missing, which centers on a different make-believe president, was a huge hit, selling more than 3.2 million copies; the new book has an announced first printing of 1 million copies.) Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton follows suit in October with State of Terror, a collaboration with friend and mystery novelist Louise Penny, which concerns a novice secretary of state trying to get to the bottom of a series of terrorist attacks.<br />“There’s just instant name recognition, and that really does make a difference when someone’s picking up a book,” says Kristen McLean, executive director of business development and books industry analyst at NPD Group, a market research firm. Another part of the appeal is the insider knowledge that people like the Clintons can bring to the page.<br />In The President’s Daughter, for instance, there is an incident echoing the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which took place during Clinton’s second term. “You can do your research, and that helps,” Patterson says. “But there’s a big difference between learning everything you can about bees and beeswax because it fits into your book versus what really goes through a president’s mind, what really happens.” Patterson says it might surprise readers who comes up with what. “With the first book, there were certain reviewers who said, ‘I know exactly what Clinton wrote and what Patterson wrote,’” he recalls. “And they were totally wrong.”<br />Sometimes the plots extend well beyond what any politician has actually experienced. In The President Is Missing, for instance, the leader of the free world slips away from his Secret Service detail in an effort to foil a large-scale cyber-terror attack; along the way, the president gets into a shootout with assassins. “The story is a little over the top,” Patterson says. “Although, you know, in this day and age, what’s over the top?”</td>

Muji says it uses cotton from the Xinjiang region–where the U.S. State Department says mostly Muslim Uyghurs are forced to labor in internment camps—and doesn’t see a problem with advertising that fact.<br />Muji, a Tokyo-based clothing and homewares brand owned by  Ryohin Keikaku Co . , gets about half its revenue outside its home market from China. A fraction comes from the U.S.<br />Muji’s public statements represent one approach to the dilemma of doing business in China for apparel companies. Companies sometimes have to choose whether to please China’s government—and the many consumers in the country who follow the official lead—or heed the warnings of human-rights activists. Those activists say it is impossible for outsiders to ascertain whether the cotton used in T-shirts and other garments is being harvested humanely in Xinjiang.<br />Last month, Muji’s parent said it conducted an on-site audit at more than 12,000 acres of farms and other facilities in the Xinjiang region in 2020 and found no material human-rights violations. Earlier, the company had said the audit didn’t identify significant issues other than some that could be fixed.</td>

Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, was last down 0.6% at $67.92 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate futures—the U.S. benchmark—were last down 0.7% at $64.49 a barrel.</td>

While many suffered construction delays during the pandemic and might hold back on their openings, dozens of others are still on track to open this year or early next year.<br />Arlo Hotels is planning to open an upscale hotel near Hudson Yards this spring, which with 489 rooms will be one of the largest lodging properties scheduled to open this year.

      <td>The Biden administration’s plan to limit a longstanding property-tax break could disrupt the business of investing in apartment buildings, discouraging both amateur and professional investors who helped fuel record multifamily sales.<br />The tax treatment enables investors to defer capital-gains taxes if they invest profits from a real-estate sale into another property. It is used to buy and sell most types of real estate, but it has been a primary source of capital for apartment-building investors. Multifamily sales enjoyed their biggest year ever in 2019, notching more than $184 billion of properties sold.<br />Karlin Conklin, principal of Investors Management Group, a company that purchases and renovates aging apartment complexes, said about one-third of the capital that her firm raises for acquisitions comes from these like-kind transactions, known as 1031 exchanges. Owing capital-gains taxes could mean less investment in existing affordable housing, she said.<br />“I think that the industry concern is that this will very much hamper transactions, and it will also then hamper reinvestment in improvements in local economies,” Ms. Conklin said.<br />President Biden proposed limiting the profits that investors can defer from 1031 exchanges to $500,000. U.S. investors save billions on their tax bills this way every year.</td>

      <td>Coaxing consumers further out of their shells will still be a tough balancing act for Beijing, as beleaguered consumer shares are signaling</td>
      <td>China’s lopsided recovery got a much-needed consumption boost last week. But coaxing consumers further out of their shells will still be a tough balancing act for Beijing as 2021 grinds on—and other growth drivers lose steam.<br />Data from last week’s long golden-week holiday offered some signs that Chinese consumers have started spending again. Chinese travelers made 230 million trips during the five-day holiday, nearly 20% higher than in the same period in 2019. Box-office revenue hit a record high for the holiday period while restaurants and hotels also did brisk businesses.  Goldman Sachs  noted that the younger generation is leading the spending.<br />Chinese consumer stocks, however, have dropped since last week. Partly that is because expectations had been running high. Shares of hot-pot chain  Haidilao International  have dropped 14% in the past week. Before the decline, the stock had gained 63% since the beginning of 2020. And official data showed that spending from Chinese travelers during the holiday was still 23% lower than in 2019.<br />The recovery in consumer spending, however, is still encouraging as so far it has been lagging behind other economic drivers like exports and industrial production. Unlike governments in developed countries, Beijing focused primarily on helping businesses—rather than households—get through the pandemic.<br />Now that Beijing is beginning to dial back support for business—credit growth has started to slow again—it needs consumers to pick up the slack. That is especially true since the industrial sector is showing signs of running a bit too hot: Producers prices rose 6.8% year-over-year in April, far higher than the 0.9% increase in consumer prices, data released Tuesday showed.</td>

They alleged that the bank manipulated the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark interest rate used to set short-term loans for global banks.<br />A unit of the German bank pleaded guilty to U.S. criminal charges, and acknowledged that it failed to adequately police employees.<br />Some CFTC officials who have reviewed the case internally have recommended the whistleblower payout, calculated as a percentage of the agencies’ legal settlements. But the application is under investigation by others, according to people familiar with the matter. Agency leaders have contended there is no mechanism to pay the bank executive and other applicants and keep funding the whistleblower program.<br />The CFTC pays whistleblowers from money it collects in enforcement penalties. But the agency’s whistleblower fund can be replenished only when it falls below $100 million. Penalties collected otherwise typically go into the U.S. Treasury.</td>

The previous day, the shares had fallen 7%. The declines took Beijing-based Meituan’s market capitalization to the equivalent of about $195 billion.<br />Three months ago, Meituan was flying high with a market capitalization exceeding $340 billion, according to FactSet, as Chinese consumers swarmed to its mobile app to purchase vegetables, groceries and household goods in bulk. In April the company raised nearly $10 billion from investors to fund new technology and ambitious expansion plans. Even after the recent tumble, Meituan is China’s third-most-valuable listed internet company, behind videogame developer and social-media company  Tencent Holdings Ltd. , and e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.<br />On Monday evening, the Shanghai Consumer Council, a quasi-government body that protects consumer rights, said it had summoned Meituan representatives to a meeting and told the company to address problems that had sparked a litany of complaints from consumers.<br />Representatives of  Pinduoduo Inc.,  a fast-growing e-commerce company that has become one of China’s top online shopping sites, were also called to a meeting by the council and told to rectify problems that included sales of counterfeit goods.

I argued last week that we are on the cusp of a major change and long-run inflation is now more likely.<br />How best to protect a portfolio against the losses that rising prices often inflict?<br />The interplay of timing and uncertainty prevents there being a single simple answer. However, there are useful strategies that can be put to work now. If you agree that inflation is more likely, it is important to act, as ordinary bonds are awful investments under inflation, while stocks overall have been poor.<br />Here are five approaches, along with their biggest risks:<br />Ask on social media how to protect against inflation, and the answer is simple: Just buy gold. Not so much this year, when the price of gold has fallen as inflation doubled from 1.3% to 2.6%. But it is true that gold, historically, has performed well when inflation is high, holding on to its value even in countries where inflation soared into double-digits, according to a study for  Credit Suisse  by academics Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton.</td>

Officials with some states said they were looking at companies in their Medicaid programs and state-employee plans. Among the companies under scrutiny are units of  Centene Corp. ,  UnitedHealth Group Inc.  and  CVS Health Corp.<br />“I’m aware of many states that are looking at this,” said Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican, whose office recently sued Centene, alleging it had misled the state’s Medicaid program about its pharmacy-related costs, resulting in overpayments by the state. States are at various stages of examining PBMs, he said, but he expects a couple of new suits to be filed this summer, and “before this is all done, I will be surprised if we don’t have a dozen or more states” bringing complaints against PBMs.<br />A Centene spokeswoman said it “provides pharmacy benefit programs for Medicaid and Medicare according to the regulations, laws and contractual guidelines issued by state agencies.” The Ohio suit’s claims are “unfounded and will be vigorously defended in court,” she said.</td>

      <td>U.S. stock futures and global indexes fell Tuesday after concerns about rising inflation resurfaced, prompting a selloff in highflying technology stocks.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropped 0.9%, a day after the broad market index declined 1% from its record closing level. Nasdaq-100 futures retreated 1.4%, suggesting that tech stocks were poised for further losses after dragging broader indexes lower at the start of the week. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.6%.<br />Investors are betting that inflation is likely to climb steeply in coming months, driven by pent-up spending as well as supply bottlenecks and a leap in commodity prices. A sharp and sustained jump in inflation would erode returns on fixed-income assets and stocks whose valuations rely on future earnings. Some money managers are concerned that it may also prompt the Federal Reserve to pare back its easy money policies sooner than anticipated.<br />“Inflation is an issue that is on everyone’s minds right now, and it is injecting a lot of uncertainty,” said Peter Langas, chief portfolio strategist at Bessemer Trust. “The question is, how does the Fed react to that?”<br />Tech companies are bearing the brunt of inflation concerns this year. Growth stocks led the market’s steep rally since last spring. Investors are increasingly worried that their high valuations may not be justified if inflation crimps the value of future earnings. This week, those concerns have spilled over to other sectors as well, leading to a broader selloff.</td>

That is good news for everyone but credit-card issuers.<br />Large card issuers that cater to borrowers ranging from the affluent to the subprime say that overall card balances—and thus the firms’ interest income—are falling. To make up for it, issuers are spending more on marketing and loosening their underwriting standards.<br />Discover Financial Services  said on its earnings call last month that the share of card balances that were paid off at the end of the first quarter were at the highest level since 2000. Capital One Financial Corp. said that nearly half of the credit-card balances it had at the beginning of March were paid off by the end of the month, which the company described as historically high. The companies’ calculations are based on the credit-card balances that they packaged into securities and sold to investors.<br />Synchrony Financial ,  the largest issuer of store credit cards in the U.S., said payment rates have been higher than they averaged before the pandemic.<br />Card balances at the three companies were down 9%, 17% and 7% in the first quarter from a year prior, respectively.</td>

The growing number of available jobs “shows how difficult it is to turn openings into hires.”<br />Many economists say a number of factors—including expanded unemployment benefits, fear of contracting Covid-19 and a lack of child care—are keeping workers from taking open jobs. There were 7.4 million unfilled jobs at the end of February, according to the Labor Department. The federal gauge of openings at the end of March will be released at 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday.</td>

Israel said it targeted a Hamas battalion commander and 15 Hamas military operatives.<br />The Palestinian Ministry of Health said 24 people have died, mostly from Israeli strikes, including nine children. Israel’s military said it is investigating reports that children were killed and that some casualties may be the result of rockets that exploded in Gaza before reaching Israel.<br />The Israeli strikes are in response to more than 300 rockets launched from Gaza since Monday evening. That began when Hamas launched six rockets toward Jerusalem, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was “a red line.” Most of the rockets have targeted communities in southern Israel near the border with Gaza. Six people were injured Tuesday morning when a missile hit a residential building in Ashkelon.<br />“We see Hamas’s attack against Israel as a very severe attack, an attack that clearly will not go unanswered, we’re answering it now,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman.</td>

The bonds, sold as part of a debt package, yield just 5.25%, comfortably below prevailing market rates.

Scientists and public-health experts are trying to better understand the role it is playing in the record-setting surge of Covid-19 cases that has overwhelmed India’s healthcare system in recent days—and what risk it poses to the rest of the world. India reported more than 366,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday.<br />Here’s what we know so far about the B.1.617 variant.<br />The variant, identified in October, is a mutant form of the virus that causes Covid-19. It has 13 mutations, including two notable ones in the spike protein that the virus uses to attach to and infect cells.<br />One of the mutations, dubbed E484Q, is similar to one that is common to the variants identified in South Africa and Brazil. In those variants, the mutation seems to make the virus better at evading the body’s immune responses. The other, known as L452R, is also found in the dominant strain in California, and may boost viral transmission.</td>

The producer-price index, a gauge of factory-gate prices, rose 6.8% last month, the fastest pace since October 2017, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday.<br />The producer figure was higher than the median forecast of 6.5% among economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. The consumer number is in line with expectations.<br />A prolonged disruption in global supply chains and the resurgence of Covid-19 in some emerging markets fueled commodities prices’ climb. That in turn pinched profit margins for Chinese producers, who gained share in global exports during the pandemic and saw overseas demand continue to boom this year.<br />“If the bargaining power of Chinese producers is strong, there is a certain possibility that the rise in Chinese product prices will spill over onto global inflation,” said Zhang Ning, an economist at UBS.</td>

The increase of 280 gigawatts in 2020 was partly driven by a rush to complete projects before government subsidies elapsed in China, the U.S. and Vietnam.<br />The IEA raised its 2021 and 2022 growth forecasts by around 25%, with an addition of 270 gigawatts in capacity expected this year and 280 gigawatts next year.<br />Growing demand for renewable power comes as governments and companies around the world try to cut carbon emissions with the aim of limiting global warming. The Paris Agreement, which the Biden administration rejoined in February, calls for cutting emissions enough to keep temperatures less than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.</td>

      <td>Virginia Republican leaders nominated political newcomer Glenn Youngkin for governor, betting on the former private-equity executive, who embraced elements of former President Donald Trump’s policy agenda, to turn around the party’s fortunes in a state that has moved sharply toward the Democrats.<br />The state’s general election in November is poised to be one of the most costly and widely watched in 2021, a political off-year between the 2020 presidential and 2022 midterm election cycles. It is expected to serve as an early indicator of the GOP’s direction and strength following Mr. Trump’s presidency and to test the intensity of Democratic turnout, especially among college-educated, suburban voters who largely backed President Biden. Virginia’s gubernatorial race is considered a perennial indicator for the midterm elections that follow it. This year’s is rated likely Democratic by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.<br />The top Republican contenders were Mr. Youngkin, who stepped down last year as co-chief executive of the Carlyle Group Inc., one of the world’s largest private-equity firms; Pete Snyder, an entrepreneur and longtime GOP fundraiser; Amanda Chase, a state legislator; and Kirk Cox, former speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates.<br />Instead of holding an open primary, the GOP in Virginia picked its nominee at a convention via a ranked-choice voting system, which allowed delegates to list candidates by preference. Delegates gathered to make their choices at dozens of locations around the state on Saturday. The Republican Party of Virginia announced late Monday that Mr. Youngkin had prevailed.<br />“Virginians have made it clear that they are ready for a political outsider with proven business experience to bring real change in Richmond,” Mr. Youngkin said, adding that he had spoken to all of his GOP challengers. “Every Republican should be proud that our party inspired such a spirited, diverse and talented field of candidates.”</td>

But it’s a glaring reminder that cyber vulnerabilities in U.S. energy and other systems are the real infrastructure problem that President Biden should be addressing.<br />Colonial transports about 100 million gallons of refined products each day from the Gulf Coast to New York Harbor, supplying nearly half of the East Coast’s fuel. The pipeline’s private operator says it learned Friday that it was hit by a ransomware attack and took “certain systems offline to contain the threat.”<br />In ransomware attacks, criminals use computer code to seize control of information systems and then extort businesses to unlock them. Sometimes they also threaten to dump sensitive intel on the web. The FBI says the DarkSide criminal network believed to be based in Eastern Europe perpetrated the attack.<br />Some in the media are minimizing the attack by noting that DarkSide is only after money and purportedly doesn’t extort schools and hospitals. Small consolation. These thieves are bent on causing damage and have exposed an enormous vulnerability in the U.S. energy system by taking down a critical fuel artery.<br />Fortunately, there was plenty of fuel in storage before the shutdown, and the pipeline should be back online this week. But meantime gasoline will have to be transported by trucks, which is less efficient. Tankers are temporarily storing gasoline off the Gulf Coast. Transportation bottlenecks were already snarling supply-chains, and the pipeline shutdown won’t help.</td>

      <td>After a disappointing April jobs report, President Biden on Monday told employers they have nothing to worry about. His view from Mt. Olympus, er, the White House tells him there’s no problem with the federal unemployment bonus, and if there is, the answer is more spending.<br />The usually camera-shy President briefed the press on short notice to address the claim that expanded payments are slowing the jobs recovery. “There’s been a lot of discussion since Friday’s report that people are being paid to stay home rather than go to work,” Mr. Biden said.<br />That’s an understatement. Employers nationwide have complained for months that Washington’s $300-a-week bonus has made it harder to find willing workers. Yet Mr. Biden brushed aside the complaints, saying he and his staff “don’t see much evidence” that the payments are a “major factor.”<br />The perverse incentive of the bonus is clear, and the evidence goes beyond the anecdotes from tens of thousands of employers. The 266,000 net new jobs in April far undershot economists’ forecasts, and the Labor Department’s latest Jolts survey showed some 7.4 million unfilled positions. Bank of America economist Joseph Song notes that any worker earning less than $32,000 annually would get a raise by going on unemployment, according to a Fox Business report.<br />Mr. Biden could reduce the self-inflicted damage by asking Congress to repeal the bonus, which is available through Labor Day. Instead he assured employers that more government aid is the key to more rapid hiring.</td>

Watch this month for the first major test of the new Administration’s ability to influence or reform the WHO.<br />The World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, will meet virtually beginning May 24. At issue is whether Taiwan will be able to participate—or whether China will succeed in blocking its attendance once again.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinkensaid Friday there is “no reasonable justification for Taiwan’s continued exclusion from this forum,” and in a statement last week the G-7 nations supported Taiwan’s inclusion. Mr. Blinken rightly noted that “Taiwan offers valuable contributions and lessons learned from its approach” to global health.<br />As of last week, Taiwan had a total of 12 Covid deaths, and last year it went more than eight months without a known domestic transmission. These numbers are the envy of the world. But China, which covets the island democracy, wants to deny Taiwan any international recognition. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman last week condemned the G-7’s statement as “anachronistic block politics” and “gross interference in Chinese sovereignty.” China may have enough support from member nations to block Taiwan’s participation.<br />That would be a loss for global health and an embarrassment for the Biden Administration.

      <td>With Covid uncertainty receding fast, and several quarters deep into the strongest recovery from any postwar recession, the Federal Reserve’s guidance continues to be the most accommodative on record, by a mile. Keeping emergency settings after the emergency has passed carries bigger risks for the Fed than missing its inflation target by a few decimal points. It’s time for a change.<br />The American economy is back to prerecession levels of gross domestic product and the unemployment rate has recovered 70% of the initial pandemic hit in only six months, four times as fast as in a typical recession. Normally at this stage of a recovery, the Fed would be planning its first rate hike. This time the Fed is telling markets that the first hike will happen in 32 months, 2½ years later than normal. In addition, the Fed continues to buy $40 billion a month in mortgages even as housing is clearly running out of supply. And the central bank still isn’t even thinking about ending $120 billion a month of bond purchases.<br />Not only is the recovery happening at record speed, excesses of fiscal policy are already visible. Consumers are spending like never before, construction is booming, and labor shortages are ubiquitous, thanks to direct government transfers. Two-thirds of all relief checks were sent after the vaccines were proved effective and the recovery was accelerating. Opportunistic politicians didn’t let the pandemic go to waste. Especially after the Trump years, Congress has decided to satisfy its long list of unmet desires.<br />Isn’t the Fed’s independence supposed to act as a counterbalance to these political whims?<br />The emergency conditions are behind us. Inflation is already at historical averages. Serious economists soundly rejected price controls 40 years ago. Yet the Fed regularly distorts the most important price of all—long-term interest rates. This behavior is risky, for both the economy at large and the Fed itself.</td>

      <td>Their election bill tries to game the judiciary by routing all legal challenges to the District of Columbia.</td>
      <td>Congress probably won’t pack the Supreme Court. But court picking poses a real threat to Americans’ rights.<br />Court picking is when Congress uses its authority over federal-court jurisdiction to stuff politically sensitive cases from throughout the country into one court that leans its way, to be buried there for as long as possible. Court-picking’s evil genius is its stealth. Americans would notice four new justices, but not changes to technocratic statutes that excite only civil-procedure professors. Despite featuring in Congress’s most radioactive bill—the so-called For the People Act, or H.R.1, which would transform elections and limit Americans’ rights to speak about them—court-picking has escaped notice.<br />It shouldn’t. H.R.1’s court-picking provision would shut courthouse doors throughout the country, attempt to game the outcome in critical cases, deny the Supreme Court the benefit of the federal judiciary’s broad and diverse perspectives, and repeal measures that expedite important lawsuits questioning government power.<br />In one neat court-picking trick, the bill would strip 93 of 94 local federal district courts, and 11 of the 12 regional appellate courts that review their decisions, of their power to hear First Amendment challenges to Congress’s regulation of political speech. All such claims—by Alaskans, Floridians or anyone in between—would be confined to the District of Columbia. Appeals would be heard only in the D.C. Circuit—the court over which Senate Democrats exercised the “nuclear option” in 2013, ramming through four judges who shifted its ideological balance. Imagine if Republicans had passed a voting-rights bill that forced Californians wishing to challenge it to sue in Louisiana, and appeal to some of the country’s most conservative judges.<br />Some complex and discrete legal fields are best assigned to specialized courts. The D.C. Circuit has some unique authority to review administrative cases involving federal agencies, and Congress created the Federal Circuit in 1982 to hear appeals in patent cases nationwide. But all federal judges should be conversant in the Constitution, and Washington-based judges are no better than those elsewhere at interpreting the First Amendment.</td>

      <td>China’s opening to grab supremacy will vanish once its neighbors develop.</td>
      <td>The American debate over China policy is heating up. Last month, Foreign Affairs published an article by Charles Glaser calling on the U.S. to retreat from East Asian commitments as American power declines. In prominent publications ranging from the National Interest to the Atlantic, analysts argue that the U.S. should moderate its China policy for the opposite reason: Beijing is a paper tiger and doesn’t deserve this attention. Further out in the liberal mists, some blame hotheaded China hawks for violence against Asian-Americans and want a softer American China policy as a way of building community at home.<br />The pushback is understandable—the American discussion has moved very far, very fast. Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass has urged Washington to make a formal commitment to defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, while George Soros has termed Xi Jinping the most dangerous enemy that open societies face. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeated his predecessor Mike Pompeo’s characterization of Beijing’s treatment of Chinese Uighurs as a “genocide.”<br />The doves are right that something as consequential as U.S.-China policy should be thoroughly debated. They are right, too, that unless that policy stands on a realistic assessment of the costs and consequences, America could find itself committed to policies that voters at home and allies abroad might be unwilling to support when the going gets tough.<br />But the biggest problem with the U.S. China policy debate today is not that it is too hawkish. It’s that the discussion is framed too simplistically. It overstates the danger of war, minimizes Washington’s chances of obtaining its objectives peacefully, exaggerates Beijing’s assets, and inflates the challenge into an inexorably growing, almost unbeatable threat. In the long run American prospects are much brighter than many hawks or doves understand, but for that reason the short-term perils may be greater even than some hawks have acknowledged.<br />The simplistic framing is wrong to cast the U.S. as a declining hegemon increasingly fearful of an inevitably rising China. Beijing is not the predestined ruler of Asia. As with Japan in the 1930s, China is merely a country tempted to exploit a temporary window of opportunity to transform the region in a way it hopes could guarantee its primacy for the long term.</td>

      <td>A judge’s ludicrous tirade targets former Attorney General William Barr.</td>
      <td>Federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson has an answer for all those hoping to heal and move on from the Trump years: Nothing doing.<br />Her answer comes by way of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. In her ruling, Judge Jackson orders the Justice Department to make public an internal March 2019 memo to then-Attorney General Bill Barr about whether to prosecute President Trump.<br />The pretense is that this is about Mr. Barr, whom the judge accuses of being “disingenuous” about his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In reality, her tirade is but the latest expression of Mueller Madness: the great liberal frustration that, in the end, there was no “there” there in the Mueller report.<br />We know this not from Mr. Trump or Mr. Barr but from their fiercest foes. When Democrats finally did get around to impeaching Mr. Trump, they made a conscious decision to ignore the Mueller report. Instead, their (first) impeachment was over a phone call Mr. Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.<br />On Dec. 10, 2019, the  New York Times  reported that, after consulting with her caucus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided the House would move ahead with two articles of impeachment. Each would focus narrowly on Ukraine. A third impeachment charge, tied to Mr. Mueller’s report, was “too much of a reach.”</td>

      <td>Some historians argue that the British could have escaped defeat and might have eventually dealt a mortal blow to the rebellious colonists.</td>
      <td>Americans from childhood are regaled with stirring tales of Lexington and Concord, the crossing of the Delaware, Saratoga, and Valley Forge. They are told almost nothing, unfortunately, about what took place during the Revolutionary War after that. These storied events occur, and then—abracadabra!—Yorktown, with little in between and few connections drawn. In “Winning Independence,” historian John Ferling seeks to fill in the blanks.<br />More than three years passed between the last major battle in the North (Monmouth, June 1778) and the surrender at Yorktown. The war was in fact won during those years, when the British, stalemated in the North, shifted to a “Southern strategy,” based on the notion that vast numbers of loyalists in Georgia and theCarolinas would rally to the cause of King and Country and put down the rebellion.<br />Thousands did fight for the British, but not enough. After shocking losses at Kings Mountain and the Cowpens, as well as in numerous skirmishes, it became increasingly evident to the Tories that the momentum was not with the Crown, and any eagerness to fight plunged. The Continental Army’s war of attrition took its toll. After Yorktown, the British will to win drained away completely.<br />These events and their consequences receive a thorough going over in “Winning Independence,” and in Mr. Ferling’s reconstruction of the Yorktown campaign, he shows how the choices the British faced might have led to different outcomes.<br />In August 1781, when Lord Cornwallis, the British commander in the South, had taken his army to Yorktown, Va., he had an opportunity, however fleeting, to get his army out of danger. French warships allied with George Washington’s Continentals had been spotted in the Chesapeake Bay, and their arrival would make escape impossible. Until then, Cornwallis might still break through the forces under the Marquis de Lafayette surrounding the port.</td>

      <td>‘This basic division is going to bedevil American society for some years to come.’</td>
      <td>From Pete du Pont’s Nov. 10, 2000, column for the Journal online. Du Pont served as governor of Delaware (1977-85), was a candidate for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, continued his Journal column until 2014, and died Saturday at 86:<br /><br />In short, the 2000 election was not primarily about “the economy, stupid,” nor the efficiency of government, nor the number of programs proposed or their cost, nor just how government should be reinvented. It was about values like the quality of education, family and ethics, and the character and trustworthiness of the man who will next lead us. Those are not bad ways to pick a president.<br />It is also clear that these concerns are not evenly spread across the country. There are indeed two Americas, one bicoastal, urban, industrial, and politically very liberal; the other rural, with smaller cities and towns, traditional beliefs about family and morality, and a moderate-to-conservative political outlook.<br />Regardless of whether Mr. Gore is successful in his attempt to overturn the result in Florida, this basic division is going to bedevil American society for some years to come. The Democratic Party is being pushed left. Mr. Gore, as either president or leader of the party, is more liberal than Mr. Clinton; newly elected senators like Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine are very left. People in the rural center will not take kindly to this leftward tilt and will be in continual tension with the other America.</td>

      <td>Loss widens on expenses tied to direct listing in March</td>
      <td>Roblox Corp.’s  first-quarter revenue more than doubled as the videogame company continued to benefit from pandemic-fueled demand for at-home social entertainment.<br />The growth came as more users spent more money on Roblox, primarily in the form of virtual currency, called Robux, used to buy in-game items like pets and costumes for players’ avatars.<br />Still, the company posted a nearly 82% wider loss in the period, its first quarterly report since it started trading publicly in March, on higher costs to support its growth and expenses tied to its direct listing.<br />Roblox said Monday that the results reflect strong engagement among users, most of whom are under the age of 13. The company didn’t issue a new outlook for the current quarter, but has previously warned that growth is likely to slow as social-distancing guidelines ease. It is working to attract users of older demographics and expand geographically in regions such as Western Europe and East Asia.<br />Roblox is attracting more users to its platform, with the number of average daily users at 42.1 million in the quarter, up 79% from last year, driven by growth outside of its core market of the U.S. and Canada. Average bookings per daily user, which represents the amount of Robux purchased, rose 46% to $15.48.</td>

      <td>Endorsement from former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly follows others from police unions</td>
      <td>Liz Crotty is cementing a position as the most traditional, law-and-order candidate for Manhattan district attorney in a group of more progressive contenders, with former New York City Police Department commissioner Raymond Kelly endorsing her campaign Monday.<br />Mr. Kelly’s endorsement added to a growing support for Ms. Crotty from current and former police officers, including four unions representing the New York Police Department sergeants, lieutenants, captains and detectives. Mr. Kelly’s backing came two days after a 4-year-old girl in a stroller and two women were shot in Times Square, adding to concern about gun violence and crime in the city.<br />“Liz Crotty is the whole package, someone who knows the courtroom from both sides as a prosecutor and a defense attorney, and knows that police officers are an irreplaceable partner in keeping the city safe,” said Mr. Kelly, who worked as commissioner under two mayors, David Dinkins, a Democrat, and Michael Bloomberg, who ran as both a Republican and independent.<br />Ms. Crotty is among eight candidates running in the June 22 Democratic primary to replace Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., a three-term Democrat who announced this year he wouldn’t seek re-election. The winner is likely to be the next district attorney in a borough where Democrats widely outnumber Republicans.<br />Ms. Crotty is a former Manhattan prosecutor who has worked as a criminal- defense attorney for more than a decade. She presents herself as a centrist, “safety first” candidate in contrast with her opponents who have campaigned on plans to jail fewer people and end racial disparities in the justice system. Ms. Crotty said she was the only candidate who hadn’t released a list of crimes she won’t prosecute and was more concerned with being a fair prosecutor than a progressive one.</td>
