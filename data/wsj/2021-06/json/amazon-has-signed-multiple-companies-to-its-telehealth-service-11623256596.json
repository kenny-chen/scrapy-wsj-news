    "body": "Amazon . com Inc. has signed multiple companies to its Amazon Care telehealth service and will need thousands of employees to scale the service, company executive Babak Parviz said Wednesday.<br />The tech giant has used Amazon Care for employees in Seattle since 2019 and it is highly rated by employees, Mr. Parviz, an Amazon vice president and former  Google  executive who is involved in running the program, said at the WSJ Tech Health event.<br />The service begins with a chatbot, then allows for a virtual visit with a health professional. If needed, a mobile medic will visit a user within 60 minutes; the medic is capable of conducting routine tests such as for strep throat, giving vaccinations or even taking blood samples. Prescriptions can be delivered to the person’s address within two hours, Mr. Parviz said.<br />“It’s quite different from anything we’ve had in the past,” Mr. Parviz said.<br />Amazon is expanding the digital component of the service to all 50 states this summer, and plans to bring the full service to the Baltimore and Washington, D.C., area soon. The company wants to expand to the full service over time, he said. Reaching that scale will require thousands of employees, he said."
