    "body": "SHANGHAI— Tesla Inc.’s  sales in China rebounded in May after a short slump, a boost for the electric-vehicle maker as it looks to overcome its first major stumble in one of its most important markets.<br />Tesla delivered 21,936 cars to Chinese customers in May, the China Passenger Car Association said Tuesday, almost double the number sold the month before, but still well below the near 36,000 it shipped in March. The company doesn’t publish its own monthly sales figures and it didn’t respond to questions.<br />In recent weeks Tesla has endured a run of bad publicity over its handling of customer complaints and perceived quality problems, denting its image among Chinese consumers. In an April post on its Weibo social-media account, Tesla assured customers that it takes quality concerns seriously. “If there is a problem with Tesla products, Tesla will absolutely take responsibility,” it said.<br />While Tesla’s reputation has undoubtedly taken a hit, the May sales data suggest many local consumers are sticking with the American EV brand, which started building the Model Y at its Shanghai plant in January and is ramping up deliveries.<br />However, Cui Dongshu, the association’s secretary-general, has warned it may be too early to know how seriously the negative publicity has damaged Tesla since many of the cars being delivered in May would have been ordered before the auto maker’s recent setbacks."
