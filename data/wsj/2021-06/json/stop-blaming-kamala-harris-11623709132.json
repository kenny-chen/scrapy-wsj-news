    "body": "Kamala Harris has been home almost a week now from her first foreign trip as vice president. Even so, the political class is still feasting off the disaster that her two-day visit to Guatemala and Mexico became.<br />Republicans are mocking the vice president not only for continuing to avoid a visit to the border but for her inability to articulate exactly what Joe Biden plans to do about the record number of people trying our southern border with Mexico. The U.S. Border Patrol reports that in May it stopped 180,034 people trying to cross through there, the highest number since Mr. Biden took office and nearly eight times the 23,000 stopped in May 2020.<br />No doubt this explains why on her first stop, in Guatemala, Ms. Harris tried to deliver some of the clarity that her Latin American hosts complain has been lacking from the administration. To anyone “thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border,” she said, the message is simple: “Do not come. Do not come.” The U.S., Ms. Harris said, will “enforce our laws,” and “you will be turned back.”<br />But this only provoked a new round of criticism—this time from her left. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that she found the vice president’s words “disappointing,” and others have piled on.<br />Even the White House bailed on her behind the scenes. CNN reports that “some administration officials are quietly perplexed” by Ms. Harris’s performance, and worry that her trip was “perhaps overshadowed” by the awkward answers she gave about the border."
