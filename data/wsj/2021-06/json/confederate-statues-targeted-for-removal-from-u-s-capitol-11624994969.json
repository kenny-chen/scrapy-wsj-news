    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House is expected to vote Tuesday on a bill that would remove statues of Confederates and other historical figures who advocated for slavery or white supremacy from public display in the U.S. Capitol.<br />The vote comes as Congress and the nation continue to grapple with America’s history of slavery and segregation. The extent to which racism remains embedded in American institutions and society, from schools to police departments, has sparked a fierce political debate in the year since the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The bill next heads to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain.<br />“Symbols of slavery, sedition and segregation have no place in the halls of Congress,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.), a sponsor of the bill.<br />Some Republicans said the bill was misguided.<br />“Make no mistake, those who won the West and George Washington are next,” said Rep. Matt Rosendale (R., Mont.), who planned to vote no."
