    "body": "The Education Department has approved another $500 million in loan-forgiveness requests from former ITT Technical Institute students who say they were swindled by the now-defunct chain of schools, as the Biden administration expands its use of debt-relief programs.<br />The loans of 18,000 former students are being forgiven under a legal provision known as borrower defense to repayment, which allows students to have their debts erased if they prove they were defrauded by their schools. The group whose loans were addressed Wednesday said the for-profit ITT Tech provided deceptive information about their employment prospects and whether credits earned there would transfer to other schools.<br />ITT Tech shut down in 2016, after the government banned it from enrolling new students receiving federal aid. The chain offered degrees in fields including criminal justice, computer drafting and nursing.<br />The Biden administration has said it wants to address America’s crisis in student loans, which collectively have roughly $1.6 trillion in outstanding debt as of March 31. The administration has said it is considering more widespread loan forgiveness but hasn’t laid out any such plans. For now, it is pursuing more targeted relief efforts.<br />The Obama administration used borrower defense to forgive debt of borrowers who attended schools it accused of deceptive marketing."
