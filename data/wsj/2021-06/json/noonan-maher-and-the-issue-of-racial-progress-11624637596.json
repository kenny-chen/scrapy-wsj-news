    "body": "Regarding Peggy Noonan’s “Bill Maher Diagnoses Liberal ‘Progressophobia’ ” (Declarations, June 19): If only the less powerful among us felt the same freedom in college classrooms and in everyday conversation as Mr. Maher does in openly speaking his mind. Instead, we hold back when we hear the constant drumbeat: “Whites continue to be oppressors, blacks perpetual victims.” What could be more racist than that, or more demeaning? And is that the recipe for success, the way to motivate and inspire?<br />The tragedy today is that we are all subjected to the perpetual diatribe, “us against them,” until too many begin to believe it. That message perpetuates the racial strife, hate and distrust that progressives aim to eradicate.<br />Eva Zimmerman<br />Jamaica, N.Y.<br />"
