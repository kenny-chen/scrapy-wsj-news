    "body": "Meatpacker  JBS SA  was hit by a ransomware attack that took a big chunk of U.S. beef-and-pork processing offline, sending buyers scrambling for alternatives and raising pressure on meat supplies.<br />Brazil-based JBS, the world’s biggest meat company by sales, told the Biden administration that it was the victim of a ransomware attack, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday. She said JBS reported that the attack originated from a criminal group likely based in Russia.<br />“The White House is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals,” Ms. Jean-Pierre said.<br />JBS had no immediate comment on the White House’s description of the attack.<br />The attack against JBS is the latest in a growing number to hit a range of businesses and institutions, including hospitals, the oil industry and local water supplies."
