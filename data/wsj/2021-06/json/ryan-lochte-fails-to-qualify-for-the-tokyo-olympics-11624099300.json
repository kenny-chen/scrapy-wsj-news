    "body": "Ryan Lochte left the Rio 2016 Olympics in disgrace. He wanted to erase those memories by making it to the Tokyo 2021 Olympics.<br />It isn’t going to happen.<br />Lochte came to Omaha angling to qualify for his fifth Olympics and reclaim the reputation he tarnished on one infamous night at a Rio de Janeiro gas station five Augusts ago. Lochte came up 2.7 seconds short in the 200-meter individual medley, his signature event, and failed to qualify for the Tokyo Games.<br />Lochte had been a Team USA sensation alongside Michael Phelps, the sport’s most decorated athlete. But Lochte’s last Olympics ended in disaster. In 2016, he dyed his hair silver and won a gold medal in the 4×200-meter free relay. He is mostly remembered, however, for a dust-up with Brazilian police as the swimming competition was winding down.<br />Lochte claimed that he and three other U.S. swimmers were robbed at gunpoint at a gas station, a story that became an international scandal. Over the course of several days, however, Lochte’s story disintegrated. It turned out that, after a night of partying, at least one of the swimmers had damaged property in the gas-station restroom before being confronted by armed security guards."
