    "body": "SURESNES, France—In the days before French midfielder N’Golo Kanté dominated World Cup matches and Champions League finals, his youth coach would drive him around the Paris suburbs trying to show off a subtle, yet crucial point about his game.<br />Kanté looks small, he would tell bigger clubs on the hunt for talent, but believe me, he’s not too small to be useful. It was a tough case to make considering Kanté is 5-foot-6 on a good day.<br />“Today he’s listed at 5-6,” said Pierre Ville, the former technical director here at JS Suresnes. “I’m not convinced he’s even that tall.”<br />A decade later, Kanté hasn’t grown, but his stature in world soccer is enormous and he is a key part of France’s bid to win the European Championship this summer.<br />At 30, he has won almost every other piece of hardware available: the World Cup, the Premier League, the FA Cup, the Europa League, and the Champions League. He was an essential piece of Leicester City’s 5,000-to-1 run to the English title in 2016. And last month, he was voted man of the match as Chelsea became European club champion."
