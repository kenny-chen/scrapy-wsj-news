    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Biden administration has issued a monthlong extension of a moratorium, through July, on the eviction of tenants who have fallen behind on their rent during the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.<br />An extension is needed to prevent a wave of evictions before states and local governments can distribute about $47 billion of rental assistance authorized by Congress to cover unpaid back rent, administration officials said. Progress has been slow.<br />The CDC said the move is intended to be the final extension of the moratorium.<br />It comes as the Supreme Court is weighing an emergency request by landlords and real-estate companies to clear the way for evictions after a federal judge in Washington ruled last month that the moratorium was legally unsupportable. The judge who issued that ruling stayed the effect of the decision while litigation continues.<br />The CDC moratorium, which originated from an executive order signed by then-President Donald Trump, shields tenants who have missed monthly rent payments from being forced out of their homes if they declare financial hardship. They still owe the back rent."
