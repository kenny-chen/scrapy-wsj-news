    "body": "The Brooklyn Nets, Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz were the betting favorites to win the NBA championship at the beginning of the playoffs. Now they have something else in common: They are out—and so were their best players.<br />LeBron James and the defending champion Lakers lost in the first round after Anthony Davis injured his groin. The Jazz had the league’s best record and still lost in the second round because Mike Conley missed five games with a strained hamstring while Donovan Mitchell was limping around on a sprained ankle.<br />Then it was the Nets’ turn for their All-Star point guard and shooting guard to get hurt.<br />The Nets already had plenty of experience with the unpleasantness of injuries by then.  They were so decimated that Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving were on the court together for only 202 minutes. They came into the playoffs as the basketball version of a TikTok. Never had so much time been devoted to making sense of so little time.<br />They were healthy when the playoffs began—until they weren’t. Harden strained his hamstring. Irving sprained his ankle. Durant was so brilliant that they almost survived anyway. But not even the game’s most transcendent player was enough for the Nets to beat their injury problems."
