    "body": "SPACs and green companies were two of the hottest pandemic investments. Combining the two—green SPACs—has been even more profitable, but there is evidence this is changing.<br />Special-purpose acquisition companies that pledge to merge with renewable-energy, electric-vehicle and other sustainable businesses raised more than $120 billion since March 2020. SPACs, known as blank-check companies, raise cash from investors with the goal of buying a private company.<br />For years, those deals have paid off. Going back to 2016, green-focused SPACs that have completed their acquisitions have outperformed other SPACs that have done deals, according to a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of information provided by SPAC Research.<br />In the 90 days after their deals closed, SPACs with a green focus posted average share-price gains of just over 10%, according to that analysis. Share prices of all other SPACs fell by an average of 3%. Share prices of SPACs often rise after deals are announced and then weaken after the deals close.<br />Enthusiasm for SPACs, especially green ones, has waned in recent months. Since late last year, shares of green-focused companies that have announced acquisitions but have yet to close their deals have fallen by an average of 24% in 90 days after the deals were announced; shares of other SPACs have fallen by an average of 9%."
