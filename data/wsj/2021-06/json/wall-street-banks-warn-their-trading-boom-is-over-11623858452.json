    "body": "The Wall Street boom is petering out at U.S. banks.<br />For much of 2020 and through the first quarter of this year, the biggest U.S. banks posted blockbuster results from trading stocks and bonds and advising companies on deals. The Federal Reserve flooded the market with money, companies raced to sell new debt and go public, and traders on Reddit and from big institutions moved those securities quickly. Banks at the middle of all of those transactions reaped the rewards.<br />Now, executives are warning that their market revenue is tumbling, at least compared with the past year.<br />JPMorgan  Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon said at a financial conference this week that his firm’s trading revenue, both fixed-income and equities, would be over $6 billion in the second quarter. That would be down some 38% from the year-ago period, when the bank made a record $9.7 billion.<br />“Still pretty good” is how Mr. Dimon described it. Indeed, $6 billion would have been near a quarterly record at any time before 2020."
