    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a plea from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  to raise the bar for shareholder lawsuits alleging fraud, but returned a class-action lawsuit against the company to a lower court for further proceedings.<br />At issue was an investor lawsuit filed in 2011 that alleged Goldman artificially inflated its share price before, during and after the 2007-09 financial crisis. The suit said the firm falsely claimed that it was complying with ethical rules when in fact it was riddled with undisclosed conflicts of interest in its packaging and selling of mortgage-backed securities.<br />“Our clients’ interests always come first,” was one of the generic statements plaintiffs, including the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, alleged was fraudulent with the effect of artificially maintaining Goldman’s stock price.<br /><br />“Our reputation is one of our most important assets,” the company had said. “We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest.”"
