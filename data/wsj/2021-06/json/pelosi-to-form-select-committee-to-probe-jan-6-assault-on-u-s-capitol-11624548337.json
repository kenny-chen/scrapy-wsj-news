    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said she will establish a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, after Senate Republicans blocked an earlier effort to establish a bipartisan independent commission.<br />The committee will investigate and report on the facts and the causes of the attack and will make recommendations for the prevention of any future attacks, Mrs. Pelosi said.<br />The speaker had signaled her intention to form a select committee earlier this week during a meeting with the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, according to people familiar with the matter. But the formal announcement didn’t come until Thursday morning.<br />“Jan. 6 was one of the darkest days in our nation’s history,” Mrs. Pelosi said at a press conference Thursday, calling the violent attack a “gleeful desecration of the Capitol.” She said it is “imperative that we establish the truth of that day, and ensure that the attack of that kind cannot happen, and that we root out the causes of it all.”<br />Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday that the Justice Department has arrested more than 500 people in connection with the Capitol riot, including at least 100 people on charges of assault of a police officer."
