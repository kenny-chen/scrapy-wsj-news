    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Nestlé USA and Cargill Inc. can’t be sued in U.S. courts for abuses allegedly committed in Ivory Coast, where plaintiffs accused the food-processing giants of obtaining cocoa from plantations that relied on the forced labor of children.<br />The court, in a decision by Justice Clarence Thomas, said the plaintiffs’ case didn’t have enough of a connection to the U.S. to proceed.<br />“Nearly all the conduct that they say aided and abetted forced labor—providing training, fertilizer, tools, and cash to overseas farms—occurred in Ivory Coast,” Justice Thomas wrote.<br />The decision was the latest in a series of cases curbing the reach of the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law authorizing foreign citizens to sue in federal court over violations of international law.<br />Justice Thomas said the plaintiffs were impermissibly seeking to apply that law beyond U.S. borders. The court’s central holding came on an 8-1 vote, though justices splintered on some of the finer points of the case."
