    "body": "Oracle Corp.  forgot to read the manual about being a safe haven.<br />The 44-year-old enterprise software pioneer has been one of the hottest stocks in technology, with its shares up 27% for the year ahead of its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday. Some of that strength stems from the market’s rotation out of the sector’s more richly valued names. But many investors are also optimistic that Oracle’s long transition to becoming a cloud software business is finally starting to bear fruit.<br />Results for the quarter ended May 31 helped buttress that view. Revenue rose 7.5% year over year to $11.2 billion, beating Wall Street’s forecasts and showing the company’s best growth since 2012. That helped revenue rise nearly 4% for the full fiscal year, topping $40 billion for the first time. Chief Executive Safra Catz also told analysts during the company’s conference call that growth in the current fiscal year should exceed the rate seen the previous year; analysts had projected a slowdown for fiscal 2022.<br />Still, Oracle’s projection for the current quarter was on the low side of Wall Street forecasts. And the company also plans to lean into its recent cloud momentum by doubling its capital expenditures this year, to around $4 billion.<br />“We are confident that the increased return in the cloud business more than justifies this increased investment and our margins will expand over time,” said Ms. Catz on the company’s conference call Tuesday."
