    "body": "A group of uranium mining companies saw their stock prices plunge on Monday after news emerged that a nuclear power plant in Southeast China flagged a performance issue. It was yet another unnecessary investor meltdown.<br />Canadian uranium mining companies  Cameco  and  NexGen Energy  dropped 10% and nearly 9%, respectively, and a basket of uranium-related companies tracked by the  Global X Uranium ETF  fell 6.5%. They regained some of that lost ground by Tuesday afternoon.<br />Monday’s reaction came after CNN reported that the U.S. government was assessing a report of a leak—not of radiation but of inert gases—at a Chinese nuclear power plant co-owned by two Chinese energy companies and French energy company EDF.<br />The market response is almost comparable to what happened after the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, which led Cameco shares to fall almost 13%. But that turned into a major hit to nuclear-fuel demand affecting the industry for years.<br />Monday’s drop looks like an outsize reaction for several reasons. Uranium mining companies tend to operate on multiyear supply contracts with utilities, so there is little risk that a nuclear power plant would immediately pull back buying from these mining companies."
