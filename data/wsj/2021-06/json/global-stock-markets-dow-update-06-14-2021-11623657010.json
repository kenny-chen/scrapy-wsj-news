    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, pointing to a fresh record for the S&P 500 after it ended last week at an all-time high.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked up less than 0.1%. The broad market gauge has climbed for three consecutive weeks. Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.3%, pointing to a moderate rise in technology stocks at the opening bell.<br />Stocks have ground higher amid an improving growth outlook in many developed countries and continued central bank support. All eyes will be on Federal Reserve policy makers’ comments this week following a two-day meeting. Investors remain concerned that the Fed’s evolving views on inflation and the labor market could prompt the central bank to scale back easy-money policies sooner than previously expected.<br />“Stock markets are by and large around all-time highs. We think there is still more upside there,” Salman Baig, multiasset investment manager at Unigestion. “We’re seeing clear signs that the recovery is sustainable.”<br />Ahead of the market opening,  Novavax  climbed almost 8% after the company said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine was 90.4% effective at preventing symptomatic disease in adults in a large clinical trial."
