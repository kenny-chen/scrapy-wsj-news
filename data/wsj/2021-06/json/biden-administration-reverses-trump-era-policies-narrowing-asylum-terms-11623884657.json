    "body": "WASHINGTON—U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday overturned two cases decided by the Trump administration Justice Department that made immigrants fleeing domestic or gang violence in their home countries generally ineligible for asylum in the U.S.<br />In the first case, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had ruled in 2018 that domestic and gang violence are forms of private criminal activity generally not covered by asylum laws. In the second case, then-Attorney General Bill Barr in 2019 had stated that membership in a family—such as one being targeted by a gang or drug cartel—also generally couldn’t qualify someone for a grant of asylum.<br />Messrs. Sessions and Barr had overturned decisions made by the Board of Immigration Appeals, an internal Justice Department body that acts as an appeals court for the immigration-court system. Unlike most other courts, immigration courts are run by the Justice Department and their rulings can be overturned by political officials.<br />The Trump administration repeatedly said it believed migrants were taking advantage of expansive U.S. asylum laws, and officials took many steps to narrow eligibility to deter more migrants from coming. The Biden administration has been undoing those changes, and administration officials have said they are working on new rules through a federal regulation to more specifically define who can qualify for asylum.<br />Mr. Garland’s decisions return asylum laws on gang and domestic violence to their parameters before the Trump administration."
