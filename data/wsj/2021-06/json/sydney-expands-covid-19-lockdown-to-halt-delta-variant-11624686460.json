    "body": "SYDNEY—Sydney and surrounding areas will go into lockdown for two weeks as officials widen existing restrictions in an effort to halt the spread of the highly infectious coronavirus Delta variant across Australia’s largest city.<br />Residents of Greater Sydney and the nearby Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Wollongong regions have been told to stay at home from Saturday evening until July 7 other than for a handful of reasons such as essential work or shopping.<br />The move came 24 hours after central Sydney and three other parts of the city were placed in lockdown. Authorities extended the orders to about 75% of New South Wales state’s 8.2 million people after 12 new cases took the total from the city’s latest outbreak to 82.<br />NSW state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the lockdown is aimed at totally eliminating the local spread of the virus.<br />“There’s no point doing three days and then having the virus continue to bubble away in the community,” Ms. Berejiklian said."
