    "body": "In “A Global First: Bitcoin as National Currency” (op-ed, June 16), Max Raskin writes in favor of the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador. This development can certainly be positive, but I fear Mr. Raskin sets himself an easy target when he compares bitcoin with proposed central-bank digital currencies. If implemented, CBDCs are almost certain to be a tool of financial repression, destructive of privacy. Private cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, can be a tool of financial liberation.<br />The way the Salvadoran law is framed, it is unlikely that bitcoin will find widespread adoption. Notably, dollars are still legal tender in El Salvador. Direct, peer-to-peer transactions on the bitcoin network are also too expensive for everyday transactions. Until now, bitcoin in El Salvador has been used via the Strike app. The Salvadoran government has promised to set up an official “wallet” allowing costless transactions, but is it really wise to grant the government direct access to the monetary savings of the people?<br />I agree with Mr. Raskin that freedom in money is a worthy goal, but the Salvadoran law leaves much to be desired.<br />Kristoffer Hansen<br />Leipzig, Germany"
