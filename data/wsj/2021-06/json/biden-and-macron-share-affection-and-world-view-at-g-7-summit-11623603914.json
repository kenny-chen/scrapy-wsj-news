At one point Mr. Biden asked Mr. Macron to answer a reporter’s question for him.<br />At the summit of the Group of Seven leaders in Cornwall this weekend, the two presidents embraced each other, sometimes literally, as allies on a host of issues—from multilateralism to fighting climate change—after years of volatility between Mr. Macron and former President Donald Trump.<br />“The sun is shining, we’re on this beach, I’m well,” Mr. Biden said sitting next to Mr. Macron. “And I’m with the president of France—that makes me even feel better.”<br />“I think it’s great to have a U.S. president part of the club, and very willing to cooperate,” Mr. Macron said.<br />After a photo with the other world leaders next to the water on Friday, the two men, who were meeting for the first time, spoke for several minutes, smiling and patting backs. At one point, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen joined the conversation, but the two men remained fixated on each other."
