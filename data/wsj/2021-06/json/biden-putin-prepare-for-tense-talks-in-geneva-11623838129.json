    "body": "GENEVA—Fresh from days of meetings with the U.S.’s closest allies, President Biden is set to raise a number of thorny issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their summit Wednesday, from Moscow’s aggression toward Ukraine to alleged cyberattacks against the U.S.<br />Both sides have played down the prospects of a thaw in relations, although U.S. officials have suggested some headway could be made on sticking points such as nuclear arms control.<br />Throughout his first visit overseas as president, meeting Group of Seven and European leaders and the U.S.’s partners at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Mr. Biden has signaled that he wants to show that the U.S. and its allies won’t tolerate what it regards as provocative actions by the Kremlin and will counter the growing influence of autocratic powers.<br />Mr. Putin, who was scheduled to arrive in Geneva on Wednesday, has also flagged his interest in pursuing a dialogue with Mr. Biden, describing the American president as a more predictable leader than his predecessor, but has made clear that he won’t be cowed.<br />Both sides have acknowledged that their relationship has reached a post-Cold War low in recent years, with Moscow recently including the U.S. on its list of unfriendly nations."
