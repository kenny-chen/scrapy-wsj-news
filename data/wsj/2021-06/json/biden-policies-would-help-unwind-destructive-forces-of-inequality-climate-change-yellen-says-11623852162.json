    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. economy needs ambitious fiscal policy to help unwind destructive forces, such as racial inequality and climate change, that have kept prosperity out of reach for millions of Americans, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers Wednesday.<br />Ms. Yellen, who testified before the Senate Finance Committee, defended the Biden administration’s $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2022 in prepared testimony, calling for policies such as paid family leave, modernizing infrastructure, reducing emissions and making housing and education more affordable. The private sector doesn’t make enough of these investments to reverse long-term, structural economic challenges, such as falling labor-force participation and wage inequality, Ms. Yellen said.<br />“We need to make these investments at some point, and now is fiscally the most strategic time to make them,” she said.<br />Ms. Yellen also said the administration was carefully monitoring inflation, but reiterated that she saw current price pressures as transitory while the pandemic eased and the economy continued to reopen.<br />The White House budget projected the consumer-price index would rise 2.1% in 2021, but those forecasts were prepared in mid-February, Ms. Yellen said, before economic activity had picked up."
