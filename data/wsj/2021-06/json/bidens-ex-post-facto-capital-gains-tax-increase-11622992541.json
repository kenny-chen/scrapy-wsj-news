    "body": "Regarding your editorial “A Retroactive Tax Increase” (May 29): Not only is the Biden administration’s plan to make its income-tax increases retroactive bad fiscal and financial policy, it makes no sense if the objective of the tax increase is, as claimed, to raise revenue rather than to punish the successful, as many suspect.<br />A prospective tax increase would, if history, common sense and human nature are to serve as guides, result in a flurry of stock sales before the imposition of the tax increase as investors sell to avoid pending confiscatory rates. Those sales, of course, would result in a windfall of capital-gains tax revenue for the federal government at, ironically only to the naive, the pre-increase rates. A retroactive tax increase provides no such opportunities for tax-avoidance selling, and hence no resultant windfall for the federal government.<br />Mark M. Quinn<br />Naperville, Ill.<br />"
