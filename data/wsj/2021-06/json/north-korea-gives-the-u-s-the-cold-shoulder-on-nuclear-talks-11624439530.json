    "body": "SEOUL—In nuclear diplomacy with the U.S., North Korea is playing hard to get, for now.<br />The Kim Jong Un regime this year has rebuked the Biden administration’s outreach for engagement, without detailing what might woo them back to talks beyond vague demands. As diplomacy stalls, Pyongyang is adding to its nuclear arsenal, which President Biden has called the biggest foreign-policy threat facing the U.S.<br />The U.S., during former President Barack Obama’s second term, refused to hold high-level negotiations with North Korea, wanting Pyongyang to first show commitment to abandoning its nuclear arsenal or face isolation.<br />Now it is the Kim regime holding out. It is a well-established tactic for the North Koreans, at times treating even low-level engagement as a reward, said Daniel Russel, the top State Department official for Asia during the Obama administration.<br />“They make you work for it, sweat for it, and ultimately beg for it, so that when they do at some point sit down, you already owe them big time,” said Mr. Russel, who is now a vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute."
