    "body": "Regarding Hank Adler and Madison Spach’s “Biden’s New Death Tax and a New York Widow” (op-ed, June 14): For all the talk in the halls of government and among the business elite about “corporate short-termism,” the reality is that no one thinks more about the long term than wealthy families. Unlike politicians (who live and die in two-to-six-year cycles), these families are thinking today about how to preserve wealth for generations. And lest you think that they are simply hoarding yachts, the majority of families passing on large amounts of wealth are small- and medium-size business owners, with dozens or hundreds of employees relying on them. They built their businesses through decades of hard work, and spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about whether their company will survive for the next hundred years.<br />Anyone who wants to prevent the short-termism prevalent in corporate America should think twice about creating disincentives to long-term planning via the death tax. Families that plan poorly will squander their wealth soon enough, but those who plan well can help stabilize the national economy far more effectively than sticky-fingered politicians.<br />Jonathan Slonim<br />New York<br />"
