    "body": "There is a rule of thumb in data watching that, if you want to understand which way things are trending, you need to watch the revisions. What is happening with capital spending might be a case in point.<br />The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that U.S. manufacturers’ new orders for durable goods rose 2.3% in May from April, lower than the 2.6% gain economists expected. Much of that increase was due to a jump in aircraft orders, which are often lumpy.<br />The element of the report economists home in on to gauge capital spending plans—nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft—slipped 0.1%. Most had expected it to rise.<br />But then there were significant revisions to the April durable-goods figures, which now show that orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 2.7% in April from March, versus an initially reported gain of 2.2%. That marked the largest monthly increase since July of last year, when the U.S. economy was still lurching out of the spring shutdowns.<br />Revised data tend to provide a more complete picture of what is happening. When the Labor Department releases its monthly jobs figures, for example, it has data from about three-quarters of the employers it has surveyed. Over the next two months that response rate is usually over 90%."
