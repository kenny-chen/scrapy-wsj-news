    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department on Wednesday filed an antitrust lawsuit challenging insurance broker Aon PLC’s proposed $35 billion acquisition of rival Willis Towers Watson PLC, alleging the tie-up would lead to higher prices and reduced innovation for U.S. businesses, employers and unions that rely on their services.<br />The department, which filed the case in a Washington federal court, said the merger would eliminate competition in several different markets of value to the U.S. economy.<br />The lawsuit marks the Justice Department’s first major antitrust action during the Biden administration, though it has been investigating the deal for more than a year.<br />“American companies and consumers rely on competition between Aon and Willis Towers Watson to lower prices for crucial services, such as health and retirement benefits consulting,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said. “Allowing Aon and Willis Towers Watson to merge would reduce that vital competition and leave American customers with fewer choices, higher prices and lower quality services.”<br />A spokesman for Willis Towers declined to comment. A spokesman for Aon said the company had no immediate comment."
