    "body": "Global markets slipped Thursday, with the U.S. dollar extending its rally while gold prices retreated after Federal Reserve officials signaled their intention to raise interest rates sooner than previously forecast.<br />Futures linked to the S&P 500 index edged down 0.3%, suggesting that the broad U.S. market gauge will drop at the open a day after closing 0.5% lower. Nasdaq-100 futures declined 0.5%, pointing to a sharper retreat in technology stocks. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked 0.3% lower.<br />Gold fell 2.9% Thursday, the most in almost six months, to $1,807.00 a troy ounce. The precious metal, which doesn’t offer any income to investors, came under pressure as the prospect of higher rates made yield-bearing investments relatively more attractive.<br />The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of others, advanced 0.4%. That added to its 0.8% gain Wednesday, which was its biggest climb in more than a year.<br />Investors’ risk appetite ebbed after Fed officials Wednesday gave the clearest signals yet of their plans to gradually pull back the easy monetary policies that helped propel markets to record highs. Their median projection showed they see lifting their benchmark rate to 0.6% by the end of 2023, sooner than they anticipated in March."
