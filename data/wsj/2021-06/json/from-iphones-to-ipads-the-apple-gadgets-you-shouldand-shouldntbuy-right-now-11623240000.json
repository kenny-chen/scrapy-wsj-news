Well, maybe some year I won’t turn up in June to tell you when your iPhone buying season should end.<br />But this isn’t that year.<br />Regular readers of my column should have the iPhone No-Buy Rule™ committed to memory. Once the leftovers from the Memorial Day weekend barbecue are gone, it’s time to stop phone shopping and wait until September for the release of  Apple ’s  new iPhones.<br />Last year, I expanded that guidance to other Apple products, and I’m glad I did. Things are even more nuanced this year.<br />First, we’re right on the heels of an Apple April bonanza, where the company launched new editions of products ranging from the iMac to the remote on the Apple TV. Second, earlier this week Apple kicked off its Worldwide Developers Conference with details about iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey and WatchOS 8 coming this fall. The company didn’t announce any hardware, but the software news certainly gave hints of what’s to come."
