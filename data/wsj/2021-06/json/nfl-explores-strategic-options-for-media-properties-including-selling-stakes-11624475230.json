    "body": "The National Football League is exploring options for its media properties including selling stakes to strategic partners, a move aimed at expanding the reach of its television networks and digital services, the league told team owners in a letter Wednesday.<br />The league said it has hired  Goldman Sachs  Group Inc. to explore potential partnerships for the properties, which include the NFL Network and RedZone pay-TV channels as well as NFL.com.<br />The decision to seek partners is motivated by the league’s belief that its TV and digital holdings will benefit from being aligned with bigger media and technology companies rather than remaining stand-alone operations, league and team officials said.<br />“As the whole world of communications and digital media changes, we want to find a partner who can further help us maximize the reach and potential the NFL assets represent,” said New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft in an interview. Mr. Kraft is chair of the league’s media committee.<br />League and team officials stressed that they aren’t looking to sell the networks, and said the NFL will maintain control of them."
