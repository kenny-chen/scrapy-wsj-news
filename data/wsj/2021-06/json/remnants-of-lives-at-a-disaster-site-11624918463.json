    "body": "Theyâ€™ll know it when they find it. As if their hearts can be broken any further.<br />It may be a paperback novel, left on a bedside table last Wednesday night with a credit-card receipt placed as a bookmark where the person who was reading stopped.<br />It may be a grocery list, handwritten and pinned to a corkboard in the kitchen, a reminder of what to bring home from the supermarket in the morning.<br />It may be a magazine with the mailing label still intact, or a wristwatch with an inscription engraved on the back, or a phone bill unopened in its envelope.<br />The second wave of heartache from where last week the condominium collapsed in Surfside, Fla., will be delayed, and will be more private than what is currently unfolding. For some families it may come weeks or months from now, and the grief will be no less shattering."
