    "body": "Scams are running rampant in the cryptocurrency markets as a huge rally in bitcoin, a lack of regulation and the anonymity of digital money have created a ripe environment for fraudsters.<br />Consumers reported losing nearly $82 million to crypto scams during the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021, more than 10 times the amount from the same six-month period a year earlier, according to the Federal Trade Commission.<br />From October to March, the price of bitcoin jumped 450% to nearly $59,000, while rival coins such as ether and dogecoin also surged. Bitcoin has since retreated to around $36,000, still substantially higher than where it traded for all of last year.<br />Scammers have targeted everyone from small investors scouring social media for investing tips to the Wall Street veterans who backed an Australian crypto-fund manager recently charged with running a $90 million fraud.<br />Sebastian, a 28-year-old pharmacy technician, is still kicking himself after he lost about $10,000 in ether to a crypto venture whose anonymous creators vanished in May, leaving behind hundreds of unhappy investors."
