    "body": "Munich<br />Germany manager Joachim Löw did his best to keep a straight face when he saw where his team landed for the European Championship. Sitting in Bucharest, Romania back in December 2019, he had just been placed in one of the toughest groups in modern tournament history.<br />The draw looked like a cruel joke. Löw and his 2014 world champions would have to face France (the 2018 world champion), Portugal (the 2016 European champion), and Hungary (the dirtiest team in qualifying—no one had committed more fouls or earned more red cards).<br />Löw, the dour Black Forest native, could only chuckle. His equally severe counterparts from France and Portugal did the same.<br />“Of course it’s a group of death,” Löw said at the time."
