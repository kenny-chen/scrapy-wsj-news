Today Boxed delivers groceries and other bulky items such as toilet paper and office supplies from fulfillment centers to consumers and businesses across the country.<br />Many people have become used to shopping online for groceries over the past year. Mr. Huang said he expects shoppers to continue trying new products and a wider range of services via delivery."
