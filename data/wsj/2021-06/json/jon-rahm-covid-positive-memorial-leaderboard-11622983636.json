    "body": "Jon Rahm sank his final putt at the Memorial Tournament on Saturday with a six-stroke lead and a cakewalk to a lucrative purse.<br />Moments later he was in agony. He had tested positive for Covid-19.<br />Rahm withdrew from the tournament—and forfeited his chance to win nearly $1.7 million—after officials informed him of his positive result. The incident was a stark reminder that while vaccines have provided a safety net for fans to return to golf tournaments, NBA arenas and MLB stadiums, the virus isn’t yet done upending those same sports events.<br />For Rahm, the consequences have a price tag. The 26-year-old Spaniard, ranked No. 3 in the world, is perhaps the best golfer today without a major to his name. His brilliant play in this tournament at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio was highlighted by a hole-in-one during his second round. He had a huge lead and there was no reason to think there was any chance of him getting caught.<br />Then as he walked off the 18th green he was informed of perhaps the only thing that could beat him: coronavirus."
