    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court declined on Monday to consider a Virginia school board’s plea to exclude a transgender boy from the men’s bathroom.<br />The closely watched case centered on Gavin Grimm, who twice won decisions at the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., after the Gloucester County school board imposed policies limiting him to the girls’ room or a stand-alone unisex lavatory.<br />The court, in a brief written order, said it wouldn’t consider the case. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito indicated they would have heard the board’s appeal.<br />“Being forced to use the nurse’s room, a private bathroom, and the girls’ room was humiliating for me, and having to go to out-of-the-way bathrooms severely interfered with my education,” Mr. Grimm said in a statement through the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented him in court. “Trans youth deserve to use the bathroom in peace without being humiliated and stigmatized by their own school boards and elected officials.”<br />A Gloucester County school board representative couldn’t immediately be reached for comment."
