    "body": "GameStop Corp.’s  named a new chief executive and finance chief, and made Ryan Cohen chairman, as the videogame retailer looks to leverage its recent popularity with investors to reverse years of languishing sales and strategic missteps.<br />Matt Furlong will take over the CEO role from George Sherman, who is slated to resign by July 31, though he was re-elected to the company’s board. GameStop said Mr. Furlong is a veteran e-commerce leader and most recently oversaw  Amazon.com Inc.’s  Australia business during a period of substantial growth.<br />The company named Mike Recupero, a 17-year Amazon veteran, as finance chief. The CFO position has been filled on an interim basis since Jim Bell stepped down in March.<br />Mr. Furlong is slated to join GameStop June 21 and Mr. Recupero on July 12.<br />The appointments, which also came as the company reported stronger-than-expected sales in the most recent quarter, mark a new strategic direction. Mr. Cohen, co-founder of online pet supplies retailer Chewy Inc., has spent seven months pushing for GameStop to move faster into e-commerce and away from its bricks-and-mortar roots, among other initiatives. All the while, the company has been at the center of a monthslong, social-media-fueled trading frenzy that has drawn the curiosity of individual investors, Wall Street firms and regulators."
