    "body": "A federal judge sentenced a California businessman to 2½ years in federal prison Friday for orchestrating an international scheme that tricked U.S. banks into processing more than $150 million in marijuana-related purchases.<br />Hamid “Ray” Akhavan and his co-defendant, German e-commerce consultant Ruben Weigand, were convicted in March on one count apiece of bank-fraud conspiracy, following a trial that underscored the challenges facing the cannabis industry as it seeks a foothold in the mainstream banking system.<br />Federal prosecutors had described Mr. Akhavan, 43 years old, as the mastermind behind the scheme, which involved disguising the purchase of cannabis products through shell companies, false merchant codes and payment-processing companies around the world. Evidence presented at trial, including by a cooperating witness, showed that the conspirators sought help from defunct German payment giant Wirecard AG and met with a former top executive there.<br />A bankruptcy administrator for Wirecard didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />A lawyer for Mr. Akhavan declined to comment on the sentence."
