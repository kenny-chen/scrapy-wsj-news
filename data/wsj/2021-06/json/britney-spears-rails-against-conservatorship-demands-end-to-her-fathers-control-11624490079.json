    "body": "Britney Spears broke her long silence about the legal arrangement that has left her largely without control over her finances for more than a decade.<br />“I’m not happy. I can’t sleep,” Ms. Spears said Wednesday in a court hearing. “I’m so angry, it’s insane.”<br />Speaking before a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, Ms. Spears, 39, railed against her father and lambasted the 13-year-old conservatorship that gives him power over her estimated $50 million-plus fortune.<br />“I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive,” Ms. Spears said in a profanity-laced speech, her voice anguished. It is “doing me way more harm than good,” she added. “I desire to have a life.”<br />Ms. Spears said she wants the conservatorship to end without an evaluation of her mental health, something the judge could require."
