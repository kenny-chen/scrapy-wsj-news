    "body": "Second Amendment advocates and California Democrats are squaring off in a series of fights that began in the courtroom of a single San Diego judge and could ultimately alter the national debate over gun control.<br />Opponents of firearms regulations have steered a string of cases to U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez and he has struck down three major California gun laws, including the state’s assault-weapons ban earlier this month. He previously overturned a ban on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds in 2019, and mandatory background checks for ammunition purchases in 2020.<br />The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where the majority of judges were appointed by Democratic presidents, has temporarily halted Judge Benitez’s rulings from taking effect while it considers appeals by the state.<br />Gun-rights advocates said they hope to ultimately take at least one of the Benitez cases to the U.S. Supreme Court. An affirmation of Judge Benitez’s rulings there could set a precedent making it more difficult for Democratic-led states to enact gun-control laws at a time when similar proposals are stalling in the U.S. Congress.<br />Several justices on the Supreme Court have in recent years shown interest in hearing more gun cases. In April, the court took up a potentially significant case involving restrictions on carrying a gun outside the home."
