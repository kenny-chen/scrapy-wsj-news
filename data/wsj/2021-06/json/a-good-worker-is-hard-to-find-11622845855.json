    "body": "Broad vaccine distribution and the end of government lockdowns should result in soaring job creation. Yet the U.S. labor market turned in its second disappointing result in a row in May, according to Friday’s Labor Department report. That’s what happens when government pays Americans not to work.<br />Employers created 559,000 net new jobs in the month, which sounds great until you notice that 1.5 million fewer workers in May said they were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic. Most of those workers should have found new jobs but didn’t.<br />The civilian labor force shrank in May by 53,000, and the number of men over age 20 who were employed fell by 8,000. The labor participation rate declined to 61.6%, even as the jobless rate fell to 5.8% from 6.1%.<br />All of this confirms that willing workers are getting increasingly hard for employers to find. Initial weekly jobless claims are falling, and this week dipped below 400,000 for the first time since the early days of the pandemic. But continuing claims have fallen little since March.<br />What gives? The Occam’s razor explanation is that in March the Biden Administration and Congress ladled out another mountain of cash to Americans—work not required. The extra $300 a week in enhanced jobless benefits is one problem, since millions of Americans can make more staying on the couch. This jobless pay isn’t subject to the payroll tax, unlike wage and salary income."
