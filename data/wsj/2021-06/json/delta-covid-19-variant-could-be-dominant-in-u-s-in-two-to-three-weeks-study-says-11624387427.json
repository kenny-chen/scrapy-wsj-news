    "body": "The highly transmissible Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus is spreading so rapidly in the U.S. that it could become the dominant strain in the next two to three weeks, researchers said, adding urgency to the nationwide vaccination drive.<br />The Delta strain, which first emerged in India in late 2020 and is also known as B.1.617.2, will probably make up 50% of Covid-19 infections in the U.S. by early to mid-July, said William Lee, vice president of science at population genomics company Helix and an author of the new analysis.<br />The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data on Tuesday showing that the prevalence of the Delta strain more than doubled over the two weeks ended June 19 to 20.6% of positive Covid-19 test samples genetically sequenced, compared with 9.9% in the week ended June 5.<br />“The Delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the U.S. to our attempt to eliminate Covid-19,” Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, said at a briefing on Tuesday.<br />Delta now accounts for nearly half of Covid-19 cases in some Midwest and mountain states, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at the briefing. Dr. Walensky said last week that she expected Delta to become the dominant strain in the U.S."
