    "body": "In “Are Smaller Dividends From Corporations Really So Bad?” (Letters, June 25), Jim Wandrey argues we would be better off if firms reduced their dividends, as they “might invest the money in their own operations—presumably creating more jobs and new products.” But dividends are a covenant between a corporation and its owners. Stock investing involves risk, and dividends help to offset that risk. The return from a dividend is always accretive, and the yield puts a floor on the stock price.<br />Companies that make money, pay dividends and consistently grow those dividends do as well or better than growth companies, with less risk. Paying a dividend also establishes a discipline to a corporation’s capital-allocation process; everything about a company’s balance sheet is an informed estimate—except the dividend.<br />Dividends tend to keep you in touch with your children, even beyond the grave. As Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. wrote: “A man’s learning dies with him; even his virtues fade out of remembrance, but the dividends on the stocks he bequeaths to his children live and keep his memory green.”<br />Scott Kaufmann<br />Kansas City, Kan."
