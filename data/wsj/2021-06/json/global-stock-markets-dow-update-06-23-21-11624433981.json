    "body": "The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite claimed a second consecutive record Wednesday while broader stock indexes slipped in a quiet trading session.<br />With major indexes trading near all-time highs, investors are parsing signals about the path of the economy and the intentions of the Federal Reserve as they consider how much more of a rally might be in store.<br />The S&P 500 fell 4.60 points, or 0.1%, to 4241.84, off 0.3% from its record close last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 71.34 points, or 0.2%, to 33874.24. The Nasdaq Composite gained 18.46 points, or 0.1%, to 14271.73, its 16th record close of 2021.<br />For much of this year, stocks have surged from their pandemic-induced lows, buoyed by a strengthening economy, supportive monetary policy and plentiful government spending. The S&P 500 has gained 90% since its closing low in March 2020.<br />Investors are struggling to discern the path forward and have lately focused on signs of inflation, which could lead the Fed to lift interest rates from the near-zero levels adopted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Low rates boost the value of future cash flows in commonly used stock valuation models."
