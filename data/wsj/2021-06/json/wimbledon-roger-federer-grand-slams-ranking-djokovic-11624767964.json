    "body": "LONDON—It didn’t take long for word to get around the All-England Lawn Tennis Club on Friday that a couple of old-timers were knocking around on Court 14. The two men had sore hips and balky knees. They didn’t glide like they used to.<br />Still, this casual practice was unmissable for anyone in the vicinity: these old-timers happened to have 10 Wimbledon singles titles between them.<br />For the first time in more than decade, Roger Federer and Andy Murray practiced together for an hour, getting their feet back under them on grass. Which might seem strange for two men who used to own this place. But the reality, for Federer in particular, is that every trip back to the Wimbledon main draw now feels like it could be his last.<br />“Truthfully, I don’t think my goal was to play till 39, 40 or more,” Federer said here on Saturday. “It was maybe more like 35.”<br />He remembered a conversation in which Pete Sampras, who retired at 31, asked him how much he thought he had left in the tank. That was a decade ago. Federer didn’t even consider it. The chase for major titles was just too special to give up, especially with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic hot on his heels."
