    "body": "While reading Jason Riley’s beautiful tribute to Thomas Sowell (“The Soul of Black Conservatism,” op-ed, May 29), I was sadly reminded of Dr. Sowell’s comments during an interview: “One of the reasons I’m glad to be as old as I am is that it means I may be spared seeing what’s going to happen to this country.”<br />It is frightening that an intellectual giant looks to advancing age as an antidote to bearing witness to the culmination of what he believes is an irreconcilable moral and political divide between equal halves of the country; a divide which could possibly threaten the political stability of the union for decades. We hope he’s wrong, but I fear we ignore Mr. Sowell’s intellect at our peril.<br />Mike Smith<br />Sugar Land, Texas<br />"
