    "body": "The U.S. employment report is the highlight of this weekâ€™s economic data.<br />The consumer confidence index held relatively steady at 117.2 in May, after four straight months of gains. Economists expect it will pick up again to 118.7 in June.<br />After five straight weeks of declines, U.S. jobless claims rose unexpectedly earlier this month and remained higher than expected in the week ended June 19 at 411,000. Economists predict claims will fall to 387,000.<br />U.S. manufacturing activity has been expanding rapidly as the economy reopens, but production has been hampered by supply-chain problems and a labor shortage. Economists expect the purchasing managers index for June to hold steady at 61 from 61.2 in May.<br />The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in April after rising to a record level in March. Economists are forecasting it will widen slightly in May to a seasonally adjusted $71.3 billion from $68.9 billion."
