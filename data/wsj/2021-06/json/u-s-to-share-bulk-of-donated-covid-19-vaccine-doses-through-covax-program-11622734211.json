    "body": "The Biden administration said Thursday it would work through the international Covax effort to share the bulk of the 80 million Covid-19 vaccine doses it plans to send to other countries by the end of June.<br />Officials had previously announced the number of doses they would be sending overseas, but they hadn’t detailed where they would be going. Dozens of countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, petitioned the U.S. for a portion of the doses.<br />About 75% of the vaccines will go to Covax, a multibillion-dollar program to immunize the world against Covid-19 that has been struggling with supply, and they will be targeted to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa, in coordination with the African Union, the White House said. The remaining 25% will go to countries experiencing surges in cases, neighbors and those who have requested help from the U.S.<br />“As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,” President Biden said in a statement.<br />Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said the U.S. would work closely with Covax and the countries receiving the doses. The U.S. will decide where to send the vaccines through Covax in consultation with the program’s officials on their logistics and delivery capacity, he said."
