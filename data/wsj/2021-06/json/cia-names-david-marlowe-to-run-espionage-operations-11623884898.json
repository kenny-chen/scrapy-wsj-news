    "body": "WASHINGTON—In his first major personnel move, CIA Director William Burns has tapped a 30-year agency veteran to run espionage operations at a time when the spy agency is increasing its focus on China and retooling human intelligence gathering in an age of growing digital surveillance.<br />David Marlowe, who will serve as the new deputy director of operations, is a veteran officer who served overseas as the senior Central Intelligence Agency officer, known as station chief, “in several of the largest and most complex environments, including war zones,” a CIA spokeswoman said.<br />Mr. Marlowe, whose position does not require congressional confirmation, will run a directorate at the agency’s Langley, Va., headquarters that oversees undercover officers who recruit foreign spies, ranging from foreign government officials to businessmen to disgruntled members of terrorist networks. The operations directorate also conducts covert actions abroad when directed by the president.<br />The CIA spokeswoman described Mr. Marlowe’s appointment as a normal leadership change.<br />He replaces Elizabeth Kimber, who in 2018 became the first woman to lead the operations directorate, which has been a male-dominated bastion throughout much of the CIA’s 73-year history."
