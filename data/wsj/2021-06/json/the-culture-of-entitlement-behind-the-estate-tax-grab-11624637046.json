    "body": "In the June 18 letter “A Second Death Tax Will Hit Inflated Gains,” T.R. Reid considers a $408,000 tax on a $2.5 million inheritance and asks, “What’s wrong with that?” The simple, short answer is: What’s wrong with such a tax is the implied assumption that the government is entitled to a percentage of the money the taxpayer has earned and saved over a lifetime (and already paid taxes on once, or maybe more). Where is it written that the government is entitled to confiscate any of my hard-earned wealth that I wish to bestow upon my children and grandchildren?<br />Carol A. Kujawa<br />Everett, Wash."
