    "body": "Can you explain how a special-needs trust works? We have an adult child on disability and have been told we can set up a special-needs trust for her. We have an individual retirement account that we could assign to the trust, but we aren’t sure what the tax requirements are or if there has to be a required minimum distribution.<br />Good questions. Special-needs trusts have been around for a number of years, but two parts of this picture are changing.<br />First, many people with disabilities and chronic illnesses, thanks to advances in medicine, are living longer lives—and, as such, are outliving their parents and primary caregivers. That makes the need for long-term planning all the more vital.<br />Second, recent changes in tax laws—and, in particular, the rules governing inherited retirement accounts—mean that families, at the least, should review their financial plans as they apply to children with special needs.<br />Such planning, of course, has never been easy. The unknowns are unsettling (how much care will be needed, at what cost, and for how long?); tax rules are complex; fees can be steep; and whatever decisions are made, frequently, must fit within a larger estate plan that involves other family members."
