    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden won’t attend the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, but a U.S. delegation will go, the White House said Monday.<br />“He will certainly be rooting for the athletes,” press secretary Jen Psaki said.<br />Some recent U.S. presidents have attended foreign Olympics and others haven’t. President George W. Bush, for example, attended the Olympics in Beijing in 2008, while President Barack Obama stayed home for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.<br />In Tokyo, up to 10,000 Japanese spectators will be allowed at each Olympic event, organizers said last week, contrary to the advice from some experts. Guidelines released by the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo organizers said venues could be filled up to 50% capacity.<br />A Japanese newspaper over the weekend reported that preparations were under way for first lady Jill Biden to attend the Games. Michael LaRosa, press secretary for Dr. Biden, didn’t say whether she plans to go but said her team is “assessing feasibility and waiting for the naming of the presidential delegation.”"
