    "body": "Regarding Andrew R. Graybill’s review of “Forget the Alamo” by Bryan Burrough, Chris Tomlinson and Jason Stanford (Books, June 5): While a corrective counternarrative of the Alamo is rightfully needed, the modern revisionists should be cautious of committing similar fallacies by attributing too large a role to slavery. Like the earlier version, it minimizes the significant role of Tejanos in the Texas Revolution, who along with many norteños, had major grievances with the corruption and oppressive policies of Antonio López de Santa Anna, Mexico’s sometimes glorious, ofttimes vainglorious, 11-time ruler. Something they shared with their cousins later in California, by the way.<br />During this period the ruling parties in Mexico swung wildly after factional changes every couple of years between monarchists and “radical” republicans. This chronic instability left Mexico open for secession and easy prey for outside forces. A lesson perhaps?<br />Eric Zepp<br />Frisco, Texas<br />Regardless of the attacks on the character of defenders of the Alamo, they didn’t run, they didn’t give up, they stayed and fought. I am so sick of these idiotic, senseless attacks on people who became famous because they did something positive for this country."
