    "body": "Fastly Inc.  hired a Google executive to manage its finances as the cloud-services provider looks to boost its revenue.<br />The San Francisco-based firm, which operates a content delivery network service that many websites rely on to run faster, on Tuesday said it appointed Ronald W. Kisling as its new chief financial officer.<br />Mr. Kisling is set to join Fastly in August from  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, where he currently serves as CFO of the company’s Fitbit unit. Google completed the $2.1 billion acquisition of the fitness-tracking company in January after European Union officials approved the transaction with concessions aimed at protecting user data and maintaining competition in the sector.<br />Mr. Kisling has worked at Fitbit for nearly seven years, including the past three as CFO. Before that, he was CFO at other technology companies, including semiconductor-equipment maker  Nanometrics Inc.  and PGP Corp., a software provider.<br />Fastly said Mr. Kisling is set to succeed Adriel Lares, who plans to step down after five years in the CFO-role."
