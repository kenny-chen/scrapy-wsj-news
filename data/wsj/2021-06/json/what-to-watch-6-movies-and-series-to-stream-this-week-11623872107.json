    "body": "This week, we have the story of a mom who finds empowerment in aerobics, a daughter who finds her voice on a skateboard, and a son who dreams of a new life on the back of a Vespa. Plus, 30 hours on country music legend George Jones. Here’s where to stream it all:<br />(Apple TV+)<br />“Physical” is set in the malls of 1980, the beaches of San Diego and the den of a pair of idealists adapting to middle age and the material world.<br />The series, which begins streaming Friday on Apple TV+, unfolds like a fictional biopic of Rose Byrne’s Sheila, an unfulfilled housewife who is at battle on multiple fronts: with her suffocating marriage, a secret eating disorder, and the brutal voice inside her head. “You used to be someone of consequence, someone who mattered. Now you’re just an overdressed, over-the-hill, saggy-assed sad sack married to yesterday’s news.”<br />When her ballet class closes—the studio is a victim of a wave of development her husband opposes in his campaign for public office—she turns to aerobics at the local mall. There, she finds empowerment and a place to exercise her agency and ambition, becoming a star of the burgeoning VHS movement."
