    "body": "Compass  says its real-estate agents come to the company for the technology. We may soon see about that.<br />Bears have long said that the technology-enabled real-estate brokerage, which has grown its agent network considerably over the past few years, lured top-performing agents with hefty commissions and equity ahead of its initial public offering earlier this year.<br />Compass maintains that its agent contracts are based on industry standards and that it hasn’t offered anything unusual. It also says that, while it offers its agents the ability to participate in an equity program, most of them don’t.<br />Something is working, though. In its IPO filing, Compass said its principal agent retention rate over the last three years was an industry leading 90%-plus. The company didn’t disclose a retention rate for the first quarter, but said it grew its count of principal agents—who are either leaders of agent teams or agents operating independently on its platform—by 20% year-over-year during the period.<br />Compass looks to be something of an outlier.  Redfin ,  for example, said on its first-quarter conference call that it has had trouble retaining newly hired agents because the competitive housing market has made it difficult for them to win deals toward their first bonuses. Redfin said its annualized attrition rate in the first quarter was 53% among agents with less than 12 months of experience, noting retention issues for newly hired agents right now are “likely an industry-wide trend.”"
