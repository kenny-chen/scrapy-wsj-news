    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate on Tuesday approved a bipartisan, $250 billion bill boosting government spending on technology research and development amid rising competition from China and other nations.<br />The bill passed 68-32. It won approval after being delayed just before the Senate’s Memorial Day recess, as some Republican lawmakers raised last-minute concerns about its size and scope.<br />The legislation represents a potential landmark effort to turn the tide on several long-term trends in U.S. competitiveness. Those include eroding federal investments in research overall and a shrinking share of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing.<br />Backers contend the U.S. also has lacked an agency clearly focused on cutting-edge science such as artificial intelligence technology. The bill proposes an expanded role for the National Science Foundation to fill that gap.<br />“Today’s bill is about investing in that innovation economy of the future,” said Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.), who chairs the Commerce Committee. She and others compared the legislation with previous federal efforts that helped lead to breakthroughs in computer networks, energy, biosciences and other areas."
