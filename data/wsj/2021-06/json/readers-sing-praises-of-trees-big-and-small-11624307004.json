    "body": "A behemoth banyan can provide “The Benefits of a Tree Friend” (Personal Journal, June 16) and so can a bitty bonsai. Bonsai is a venerable and ancient art in which strong images of powerful trees are replicated in miniature, growing in shallow pots. I find relaxing pleasure in watering and eyeing my many 8-to-12-inch bonsai trees every day. Occasionally, after lengthy observation, I adjust the setting of one ever so slightly or gently clip a nub of errant twig.<br />Trees are wonderfully therapeutic, and that can apply whether the trees are monumental or miniature.<br />Al Donner<br />Orinda, Calif.<br />"
