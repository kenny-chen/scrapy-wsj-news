    "body": "U.S. stock futures ticked higher Wednesday, pointing to tepid gains at the open with technology stocks edging up.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ground less than 0.1% higher. On Tuesday, it ground up for its third-highest close on record. Nasdaq-100 futures edged up 0.2%, suggesting muted gains for technology stocks after the opening bell.<br />The S&P has been subdued for much of the last two weeks as investors weigh the reopening of the economy with rising inflation and supply chain concerns. The onset of summer months is prompting people to start using vacation days, leading to thinner trading volumes, money managers said.<br />“We’ve seen very low volatility over the past week,” said John Roe, head of multiasset funds at Legal & General Investment Management. “As we get into the warmer weather, we have less market participants and a less volatile environment. This reduces liquidity.”<br />Ahead of the market opening, some so-called meme stocks that have gained popularity on online forums surged higher.  Clover Health Investments  is up another 17% in premarket trading after surging 86% on Tuesday.  GameStop  rose 2.5%. The videogame retailer is set to report earnings after market hours."
