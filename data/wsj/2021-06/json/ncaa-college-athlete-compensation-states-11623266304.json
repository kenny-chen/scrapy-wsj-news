    "body": "While much remains uncertain about the coming era of compensation for college athletes, one thing seems certain: it will begin this summer in a state of chaos.<br />With several states poised to allow athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness set to take effect next month, a Senate hearing on Wednesday made it clear that Congress is unlikely to rush through a bill to create a single federal standard on athletes’ endorsement rights.<br />Meanwhile, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which blocked compensation for decades, has delayed enacting its own new rules.<br />The association says that it wants to loosen its restrictions on payments to athletes, while keeping some curbs in place. But it’s punted on doing so to date, indicating that it prefers to wait on an imminent Supreme Court decision in a case that could redefine the extent of the association’s powers.<br />State legislatures have emerged as the most powerful force in college sports, at least for now. Nineteen of them have passed bills allowing athletes to cut endorsement deals — and some of those are due to kick in on July 1, 2021. More states could still follow as their lawmakers rush to prevent their universities losing out on prized recruits."
