    "body": "Meme stocks are on the move again—while the broader market is running in place.<br />Shares of  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,   GameStop Corp.  and other stocks popular with individual investors have surged over the past two weeks, a frenetic rally reminiscent of the Reddit-fueled craze of late January.<br />AMC became the latest darling of investors who have banded together on social media in a bid to propel the shares higher. The stock has surged 97% this week through Thursday, despite retreating 18% on share-sale plans. That has extended its gains for the year to over 2,300%. Its daily average trading volume this week has nearly quadrupled the 2021 average.<br />On Friday, AMC slid roughly 7% in premarket trading.<br />The S&P 500, meanwhile, has waffled in a narrow range as investors parse signals about inflation and the labor market that could feed into the Federal Reserve’s next moves. The benchmark hasn’t notched a gain or decline of more than 0.5% in seven trading sessions, its longest such streak since February, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It is on course for a modest 0.3% weekly decline."
