    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House and Senate negotiators sought to keep a bipartisan infrastructure deal on track Sunday after its future was cast into doubt when President Biden made and then withdrew a suggestion that he would veto the proposal if lawmakers failed to pass a separate antipoverty package favored by Democrats.<br />Several Senate Republicans who reached agreement with Democratic lawmakers and the president on infrastructure appeared reassured Sunday by Mr. Biden’s statement a day earlier walking back his comments tying the fate of the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure agreement to the larger piece of legislation that could cost trillions more.<br />“I am glad they have now been delinked and it’s very clear that we can move forward with a bipartisan bill,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), on ABC’s “This Week.” He added: “We were glad to see them disconnected.”<br />Said Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) on CNN’s “State of the Union”: “I do trust the president.”<br />The negotiations at the start of a summerlong legislative blitz represent the biggest test yet of Mr. Biden’s ability to achieve a bipartisan victory in the first year of his presidency. The former vice president has pointed to his three decades in the Senate as proof of his deal-making abilities at a time of deep partisan polarization, increasing the stakes for Mr. Biden, should the deal collapse."
