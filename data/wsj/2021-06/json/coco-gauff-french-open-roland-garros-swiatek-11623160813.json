    "body": "PARIS—In putting together the deepest major tournament run of her young career, Coco Gauff has been on court for less than five hours in total. She has reached the French Open quarterfinals by powering through three victories and a walkover. And by now, she has spent more time in Paris engaged in daily games of UNO with her parents than playing in tennis matches.<br />To Gauff, it’s a sure sign of one thing: at 17, she’s beginning to feel like a professional. Her results in Paris have all been “straightforward wins, like no crazy three sets and stuff,” she said. “As we know, I have had a lot of those in the past.”<br />Nearly half of Gauff’s 16 matches in the main draws of major tournaments before this French Open have gone the distance and exposed her inexperience. In her most recent trip to a major-tournament fourth round—at the Australian Open in 2020—Gauff took the first set against fellow American Sofia Kenin, only to lose the next two 6-3 and 6-0 and walk off in tears.<br />Two years later, Gauff is already showing signs of becoming more clinical. All three of her wins here have come in straight sets.<br />“I think that you can tell that I’m improving and making smarter decisions on the court,” she said."
