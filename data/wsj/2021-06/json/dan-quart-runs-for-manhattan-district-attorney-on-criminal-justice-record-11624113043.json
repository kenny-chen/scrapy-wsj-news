    "body": "Dan Quart, a state assemblyman for eastern Manhattan, says his decade  in public office has prepared him to be the borough’s next district attorney, a job that he says can steer criminal-justice policy in a progressive direction.<br />“This is where I can make a difference, especially at this moment,” said Mr. Quart, one of eight Democrats running to be Manhattan district attorney in Tuesday’s primary.<br />In the final weeks of the race, Mr. Quart has been campaigning door to door while juggling committee and constituent work and completing a legislative session.<br />In a heavily Democratic borough, the primary is seen as the decisive election for the four-year job, which incumbent Cyrus Vance Jr. is leaving after three terms.<br />Mr. Quart, 49 years old, has campaigned on reducing the prison population, including putting an end to prosecuting crimes closely associated with poverty, such as trespassing and commercial burglaries. He said he would revamp the sex-crimes unit and stop using conspiracy laws on certain gang prosecutions, which he said unfairly target people of color. He also plans to cut the Manhattan office’s budget."
