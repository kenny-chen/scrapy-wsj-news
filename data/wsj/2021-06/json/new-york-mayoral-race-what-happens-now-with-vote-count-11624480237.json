    "body": "The winner of New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary hinges on a new ranked-choice voting system and will come down to voters’ second and third picks in the race, candidates and political consultants say.<br />Preliminary results from Tuesday’s primary show Eric Adams, Brooklyn Borough president and onetime police officer who campaigned on combating crime, holding a strong lead with more than 31% of the 799,827 votes counted as of Wednesday.<br />Maya Wiley, a progressive candidate and former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, was in second with 22% of votes, and former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia placed third with 19%, according to the city Board of Elections.<br />The mayoral primary was the first big test of the city’s ranked-choice voting system, which allowed voters to list up to five of the 13 candidates on the ballot in preferential order.<br />The ranked-choice process is in play because Mr. Adams didn’t win a majority of first-choice votes. Under the system, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The ousted candidate’s votes get redistributed to the voters’ second choices. That continues until only two candidates remain."
