    "body": "An experimental Covid-19 vaccine from  Novavax Inc.  was 90.4% effective at preventing symptomatic disease in adults in a large clinical trial, the company said, results that move the shot a step closer to global use.<br />The 29,960-person study conducted in the U.S. and Mexico also found that the vaccine was similarly effective against newer coronavirus strains, especially the alpha variant now dominant in the U.S., Novavax said.<br />The vaccine, given in two doses three weeks apart, was also generally safe and well tolerated in the study, the company said.<br />“Our vaccine works very well even though the virus has mutated significantly,” said Dr. Gregory Glenn, Novavax’s president of research and development.<br />Altogether, the results suggest Novavax’s vaccine is on track to become the fourth authorized for use in the U.S. Yet Novavax executives said the regulatory clearances are months away because the company still needs to finish preparing manufacturing."
