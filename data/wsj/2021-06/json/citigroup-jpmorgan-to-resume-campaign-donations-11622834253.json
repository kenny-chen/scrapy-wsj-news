    "body": "WASHINGTON—Two major U.S. banks said they will resume campaign donations from their political-action committee, but split on the question about whether they would donate money to any of the 147 Republican lawmakers who voted to challenge the results of the 2020 election.<br />In a memo to employees Friday,  Citigroup Inc.  said it wouldn’t ban donations to those Republicans, but would only give money to candidates who supported a set of principles, such as protecting democratic institutions.<br />JPMorgan  Chase & Co. told employees it wouldn’t give money in the 2021-22 election to the Republicans who challenged the election of President Joe Biden.<br />The announcements make Citigroup and JPMorgan two of the first large U.S. corporations to announce that they will resume political donations since halting contributions after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.<br />Citigroup and JPMorgan were among the first companies to say they would halt donations after the Jan. 6 riot. Their decisions to resume political giving could prompt others to follow suit."
