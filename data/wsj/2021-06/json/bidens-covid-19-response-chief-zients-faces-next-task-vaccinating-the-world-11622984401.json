    "body": "WASHINGTON—With U.S. vaccination rates rising and supply plentiful, the Biden administration faces a new challenge: how to vaccinate the rest of the world.<br />The effort is being led by Jeffrey Zients, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, whose team took office in January with a plan to buy so many doses that the vaccination drive could overcome setbacks. Since then, roughly 52% of U.S. adults have been fully vaccinated and the number of new cases has dropped to their lowest levels in almost a year.<br />Taking the same approach for other countries around the world presents a more complex challenge and in far greater numbers—11 billion doses to vaccinate about 70% of the global population, according to researchers at Duke University tracking the data.<br />President Biden said last month the U.S. would export 80 million vaccine doses from its existing supply by the end of June. The White House on Thursday said the first 25 million of those doses would be distributed through Covax, an international effort to supply Covid-19 vaccines to poorer nations, with the bulk going to countries in South and Central America, Asia and Africa. Some aid groups have pressed the U.S. to send even more doses to countries where coronavirus cases are surging and to invest in manufacturing facilities overseas.<br />For Mr. Zients, leading the U.S. vaccine rollout globally requires fresh planning for supply chain bottlenecks, overcoming weak domestic distribution systems in some countries and coordinating with international governments. It also means working with the National Security Council and U.S. Department of State, as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development, pharmaceutical companies and Covax."
