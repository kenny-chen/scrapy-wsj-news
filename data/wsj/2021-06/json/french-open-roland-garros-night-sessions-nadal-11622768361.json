    "body": "PARIS—As Serena Williams took a bow at the end of the French Open’s first ever night session this week, she waved her racket at the stands and looked around to take in some adulation. Midway through the force-of-habit ritual she had done a thousand times before, she realized something was amiss.<br />The stands that had been alive with 1,000 fans earlier in the day were now completely empty. Williams looked around and shrugged.<br />Though the era of pandemic tennis appears nearly over, the much-hyped night sessions of Roland-Garros aren’t quite there yet. All day, fans at the French Open can sip Champagne and bask in the glow of the red clay courts, but come evening time—when Paris starts to crackle—they are no longer welcome.<br />Night sessions start at 9 p.m. The tournament kicks out fans at 8:45.<br />That’s because until June 9, France is subject to a pandemic curfew. Though it allowed cafés and restaurants to reopen their doors on May 19, people are expected to be home by 9—a time that might normally fall during the cheese course."
