    "body": "China’s top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen via videoconference in what the U.S. termed an introductory meeting.<br />China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported that the two exchanged views on issues of mutual concern, and expressed a willingness to maintain communications. “The two sides believe that China-U.S. economic relations are very important,” Xinhua said.<br />According to a Treasury statement, Ms. Yellen discussed the Biden administration’s economic plans and “the importance of cooperating on areas that are in U.S. interests, while at the same time frankly tackling issues of concern.”<br />The conversation came a week after Mr. Liu spoke by phone to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. Both sides agreed to continue communicating, according to a statement by China’s Commerce Ministry after Mr. Liu and Ms. Tai’s conversation.<br />Mr. Liu had negotiated many rounds on trade issues with former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer during the Trump administration. His call with Ms. Yellen marked the continuation of his role as Beijing’s point man for the U.S.-China economic relations, at least for the near term."
