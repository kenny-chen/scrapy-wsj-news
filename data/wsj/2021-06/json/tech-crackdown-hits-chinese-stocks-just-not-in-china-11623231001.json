    "body": "China’s tech crackdown is mostly affecting firms listed outside the country, helping to create a big performance gap between onshore and offshore Chinese stocks.<br />In the three months to Tuesday, an iShares exchange-traded fund tracking an MSCI Inc. index of 490 onshore Chinese stocks, or A Shares, has gained 8.9%, according to FactSet. A similar vehicle that follows the broader MSCI China index is up just 0.2% over the same period. Over the last 12 months, the former has outperformed by 20 percentage points.<br />The wider index includes some shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, but is heavily tilted toward internet companies, most of which are listed in Hong Kong and the U.S.<br />Five companies— Tencent Holdings Ltd. , Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., food-delivery giant Meituan, and e-commerce platforms  JD.com Inc.  and  Pinduoduo Inc. —make up nearly 35% of the benchmark and are listed outside mainland China. The biggest company in the A-Share index is liquor maker  Kweichow Moutai Co. , with an index weight of 6.2%.<br />China’s internet-technology sector is reeling from what began in part as a crackdown on anticompetitive practices, with regulators imposing a record $2.8 billion antitrust fine upon Alibaba in April. The campaign has since become a broader effort to clean up the sector, spanning issues such as data usage and employment practices."
