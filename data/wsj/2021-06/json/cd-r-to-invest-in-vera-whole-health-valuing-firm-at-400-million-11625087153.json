    "body": "<br />Private-equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC is buying a majority stake in Vera Whole Health Inc., officials with both companies said.<br />The deal, which is expected to be announced Thursday, values the advanced primary healthcare provider at $400 million.<br />Vera, based in Seattle, has created a new model of employer-sponsored healthcare in which the employer or insurance provider pays a flat monthly per-patient fee that covers all of the employee’s healthcare needs. Under the company’s model, the primary-care physician is the leader of a team of healthcare providers who communicate with each other and oversee the patient’s health.<br />Mental-health care and health coaching, such as from a dietitian or other type of health counselor, are integrated into Vera’s platform. The Vera team, in addition to being responsible for the patient’s overall care, is responsible for keeping the cost of care in check. Vera has to return money to the employer if overall care costs exceed a predetermined threshold."
