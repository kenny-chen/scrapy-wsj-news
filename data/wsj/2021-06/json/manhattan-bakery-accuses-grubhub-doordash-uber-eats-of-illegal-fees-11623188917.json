    "body": "A company behind a Manhattan bakery has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against major third-party ordering and delivery platforms, including  Grubhub Inc.,   DoorDash Inc.  and Uber Eats, saying they have billed it and other food businesses more than allowed by New York City law.<br />In the lawsuit, Micheli & Shel, the company that operates the Michaeli Bakery on the Lower East Side, says the platforms have routinely levied fees beyond the city-imposed caps that were put into place last year as a way to help restaurants and similar establishments during the Covid-19 pandemic. The caps limit the charges to 15% for delivery and 5% for other fees, based on a customer’s order.<br />It is “a blatant violation of the law,” said Lee N. Jacobs, an attorney who represents Micheli & Shel. He said other businesses plan to join the suit if it becomes a class action. The case was filed earlier this week in federal court in Manhattan.<br />Grubhub said, “We look forward to responding to these baseless allegations.” DoorDash said it “has always supported restaurants, and claims to the contrary are simply wrong.”<br />Uber Eats, which is  Uber Technologies Inc.’s  food-delivery division, declined to comment."
