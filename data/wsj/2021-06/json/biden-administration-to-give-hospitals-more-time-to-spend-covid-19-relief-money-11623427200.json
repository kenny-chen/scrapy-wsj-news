    "body": "<br />The Biden administration on Friday plans to grant some healthcare providers more time to spend emergency coronavirus funding following an appeal from hospitals and congressional lawmakers for the extension.<br />Congress approved about $187 billion in several spending bills dating to the Trump administration to help hospitals recover losses related to the pandemic, but providers had to use the money by June 30, 2021, or return it. Many hospitals urged the administration to give them more time because they said they are still suffering financially from the pandemic.<br />With the expected announcement on Friday, the extension will provide more time to most providers who received payments after June 30, 2020.<br />The deadlines to spend the money will be staggered. Hospitals that got funds from July 1 through Dec. 31 last year will now have until Dec. 31 this year to use the money, according to federal officials. Those that got money from Jan. 1 this year through June 30 will get until June 30, 2022. Recipients of funds between July 1, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2021 will have until Dec. 21, 2022."
