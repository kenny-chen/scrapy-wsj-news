    "body": "Stop us if you’ve heard this one. A leak to the Washington Post says the FBI is investigating a prominent GOP political figure who happens to be a target of Congressional Democrats. Hmmm.<br />Skepticism is in order about the Post report on Thursday that unidentified sources say the FBI is investigating Postmaster General Louis DeJoy over accusations he broke campaign-finance laws while running his prior business. The story dished that the FBI has interviewed former DeJoy employees and subpoenaed information from Mr. DeJoy.<br />The FBI news follows a Post story in September claiming a handful of individuals who worked for Mr. DeJoy’s former company, New Breed Logistics, said he pressured them to make political contributions to GOP candidates. They were allegedly reimbursed later with bigger bonuses. If true, this is a straw-donor scheme that’s illegal under federal law.<br />Mr. DeJoy has denied the accusations, and the Post story is thin. Wake County, North Carolina District Attorney Lorrin Freeman, a Democrat, conducted a review of state campaign-finance reports and told the Post that it “did not provide sufficient indications of a pattern of improper contributions to open a state criminal investigation.”<br />Mr. DeJoy was also subject to a Postal Service Inspector General review of his finances, which reported he’d met the “ethics requirements related to disclosure, recusal, and divestment” upon taking his post."
