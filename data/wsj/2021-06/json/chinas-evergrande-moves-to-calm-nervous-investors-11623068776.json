Its bonds also have dropped in price in recent weeks, sending yields soaring, with the yield on one bond due in January 2024 topping 20% on Monday, according to Tradeweb.<br />Last week, internet users shared posts describing deep discounts to apartment prices offered by Evergrande. A May 27 article by Caixin, a Chinese financial-media outlet, said regulators were likely to scrutinize Evergrande’s dealings with  Shengjing Bank Co. , a bank in which it owns a major stake,<br />On Monday, Evergrande said it hadn’t adjusted prices, discounts or payment plans for the majority of its apartments, leaving aside a periodic mega promotion. It said it would repay a small amount of commercial paper that was overdue that it owed a few companies, and said all its dealings with Shengjing Bank were in accordance with the law.<br />“All of our operations are running normally,” Evergrande said on its website, adding that it hadn’t missed an interest or principal payment in the 25 years since its founding."
