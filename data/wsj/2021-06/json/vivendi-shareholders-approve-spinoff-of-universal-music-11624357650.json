    "body": "Vivendi SE shareholders approved the French media conglomerate’s plan to spin off its Universal Music Group unit, bringing the world’s largest music company a step closer to becoming its own public entity.<br />With more than 99% approval, shareholders backed the plan to distribute 60% of Universal’s shares to existing Vivendi shareholders and to list the company on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Vivendi executives said the listing would take place on Sept. 21.<br />Universal, home to stars including Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Queen and the Beatles, commands some 40% market share in the domestic recorded music business—30% globally—and operates the world’s second-largest music publishing company, which last year bought Bob Dylan’s entire songwriting catalog.<br />Over the weekend, Vivendi reached an agreement for a 10% investment in Universal by William Ackman’s Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd., valuing the company at €35 billion, or about $40 billion. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on the discussions. In an email to employees, Universal Chief Executive Lucian Grainge called the investment a “strong validation.”<br />Tencent Holdings Ltd. owns about 20% of Universal after the Chinese internet conglomerate doubled its stake last year in a deal that valued the business at about €30 billion."
