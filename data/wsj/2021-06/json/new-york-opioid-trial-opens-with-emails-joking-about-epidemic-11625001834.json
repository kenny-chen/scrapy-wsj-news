    "body": "As an opioid epidemic raged across the U.S. a decade ago, employees at a major distributor of prescription drugs sent emails joking about addicts, jurors were told Tuesday during opening statements at a Long Island trial seeking to blame the pharmaceutical industry for a wave of opioid addiction.<br />In one email, a corporate investigator at  AmerisourceBergen Corp.  circulated a song about “Pillbillies” set to the tune of the “Beverly Hillbillies” theme song, describing a man’s journey to Florida to get cheap painkillers.<br />“Buy some pills. Take a load home. Y’all come back now, y’hear?” the 2011 email ended. The next year, the same employee sent around a parody photo of a Honey Smacks cereal box, altered to say “Killogg’s Smack” with the box’s cartoon character holding a syringe.<br />AmerisourceBergen is among seven companies on trial over what New York’s attorney general and Nassau and Suffolk counties say is their role in causing a public-health crisis in the state.<br />In the New York lawsuit and hundreds of others, the companies have pushed back on the allegations, arguing they sold pills for legitimate medical uses and distributed them according to federal regulations. Lawyers for the seven companies will give their opening remarks to jurors on Wednesday."
