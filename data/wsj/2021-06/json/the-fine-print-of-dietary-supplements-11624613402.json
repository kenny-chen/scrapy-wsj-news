    "body": "Thanks in part to the Covid-19 pandemic, dietary supplements are more popular than ever.<br />Three out of four Americans—including one in three children—use the products to improve health, boost fitness, lose weight or enhance sexual performance, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.<br />In 2020, when demand for immunity-boosting supplements surged against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, market analyst Grand View Research valued global sales at $140.3 billion. In 2021, the market is expected to grow to $151.9 billion.<br />But federal law doesn’t require dietary supplements to be proven safe before they’re marketed.<br />Supplements include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, metabolites and botanicals such as herbs. They can be purchased as pills, powders or liquids—but they’re regulated as food, not drugs."
