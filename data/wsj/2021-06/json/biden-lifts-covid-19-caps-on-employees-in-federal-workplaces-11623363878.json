    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal agencies will no longer be required to limit the number of employees in their workplaces but will maintain a telework policy established during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Biden administration said Thursday.<br />The guidance issued by three federal agencies lifts a 25% limit on capacity within the offices of federal agencies, reversing a policy issued in January, and sets up planning for the return of workers to federal offices, such as courthouses or U.S. Embassies.<br />Federal agencies will need to complete their return-to-work planning by July 19, the administration said. The plans should address how and when employees and contractors can return to their in-person duties, according to the guidance.<br />A federal task force earlier this week said U.S. employees and contractors may voluntarily share information about their vaccination status, but it isn’t a requirement that workers be vaccinated. When a federal worker or contractor voluntarily discloses being unvaccinated or declines to provide information about vaccination status, agencies should implement mitigation measures, such as masking and physical distancing.<br />Late last month the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued updated guidance stating that federal laws don’t prevent a U.S. employer from requiring workers to be vaccinated."
