    "body": "JERUSALEM—Israeli police fired rubber bullets at Palestinians trying to disrupt a right-wing nationalist march in Jerusalem, while Hamas militants launched incendiary balloons into Israel and urged Palestinians to confront the marchers, raising the specter that a new spiral of violence could sweep through the region.<br />Mostly young Israelis, some chanting “Death to Arabs,” marched to the main entrance to the Old City’s Muslim quarter, where a few thousand dancing demonstrators gathered to celebrate Israel’s contested control of East Jerusalem.<br />Scores of stone-throwing Palestinians took part in running street battles with Israeli security forces, who used rubber bullets, batons and water cannons spraying foul-smelling water to scatter those trying to disrupt the nationalist celebration outside the Old City walls.<br />At least 33 people were injured, including a 14-year-old boy hit by a rubber bullet, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. Israeli police said two officers were lightly injured and that 17 people had been arrested during the protests.<br />The surge of violence poses an early test for Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and his two-day-old coalition government, which must decide how to respond to renewed tensions in Jerusalem and the first serious attacks from Hamas militants since the two sides agreed to a truce late last month to end an 11-day conflict."
