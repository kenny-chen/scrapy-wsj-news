    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on households making under $400,000 helped get him elected and shaped an administration tax plan aimed at corporations and high-income households. Now, that pledge is narrowing the path toward a bipartisan deal on infrastructure.<br />The White House, citing the pledge and its preference for taxing corporations and high-income people, nixed calls for higher gasoline taxes and user fees to finance a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure proposal. That resistance, combined with Republicans’ blanket anti-tax posture, has left beefed-up Internal Revenue Service enforcement as the main tax option under consideration.<br />Mr. Biden repeated the $400,000 promise during the election campaign to rebut Republican claims that he would raise taxes broadly.<br />John Anzalone, Mr. Biden’s chief campaign pollster, cited recent polling by his firm, ALG Research, and Hart Research Associates, showing a majority of respondents supporting raising taxes on those making more than $400,000 a year to pay for Mr. Biden’s agenda, which would expand federal spending on roads, broadband, preschool and community college.<br />“Middle-class voters are pissed off that they are always shouldering the burden,” he said. “The president has driven this as an agenda item and as economic policy.”"
