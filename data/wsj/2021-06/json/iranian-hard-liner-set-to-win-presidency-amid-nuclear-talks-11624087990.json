    "body": "TEHRAN—A hard-line Iranian judge opposed to the country’s outreach to the West was headed for victory Saturday in Iran’s presidential election after a politically moderate candidate conceded his loss.<br />The victory of Ebrahim Raisi would consolidate conservative control over the country’s politics, as Tehran attempts to revive an international nuclear accord that would free the country of some U.S. sanctions.<br />With about 90% of the votes counted, the interior ministry said Mr. Raisi had received 17.8 million votes, or about 62% of the ballots cast. The final results were expected later on Saturday.<br />Mr. Raisi’s main challenger, Abdolnaser Hemmati, the only moderate challenger left in the race, received about 8% of the vote, according to the preliminary results.<br />Mr. Hemmati congratulated Mr. Raisi with his victory on Instagram, saying “I hope your new administration provides causes for pride for the Islamic Republic of Iran.”"
