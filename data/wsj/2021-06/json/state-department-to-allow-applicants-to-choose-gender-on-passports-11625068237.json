    "body": "WASHINGTON—The State Department said on Wednesday it was introducing a new rule that will enable Americans to select their gender on their passport without presenting supporting medical documentation.<br />The change will more easily enable transgender Americans to have passports that match their gender identity, and the State Department described it as a step toward promoting equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people around the world.<br />The State Department also said it was taking steps to add a new gender marker for persons who don’t identify as either male or female but as “nonbinary, intersex, and gender nonconforming.” It said the process for doing so was complex.<br />“We are evaluating the best approach to achieve this goal,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.<br />Previously, passport applicants were required to present medical documentation if the selected gender didn’t match their other identity documents."
