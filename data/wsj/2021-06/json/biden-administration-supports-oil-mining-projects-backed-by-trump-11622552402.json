    "body": "WASHINGTON—Biden administration lawyers are defending oil and mining projects approved under the Trump administration, benefiting  ConocoPhillips ,   Rio Tinto  PLC,  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and others at the expense of environmental and tribal groups challenging the projects.<br />In a series of court arguments this spring, the administration has supported the Willow oil project in Alaska, the Resolution Copper Mining project in Arizona and the Dakota Access Pipeline, all of which are on federal land or need federal approval for major water crossings.<br />The legal filings have helped improve some of President Biden’s shakier relationships with lawmakers from Western states, specifically moderate Democrats and some Republicans from which Mr. Biden needs support to get his nominees and initiatives through Congress.<br />“I sense there’s a lot more pragmatism there now,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R., Mont.), who has criticized the Biden administration’s pause on federal oil and gas leasing and its decision to kill the Keystone XL pipeline project.<br />Mr. Daines applauded the administration’s recent federal court filing to defend ConocoPhillips’s Willow project against challenges from environmental groups. And he praised several recent nominations from Mr. Biden to fill out the leadership ranks at the Interior Department, including the former energy industry lawyer Tommy Beaudreau as deputy secretary."
