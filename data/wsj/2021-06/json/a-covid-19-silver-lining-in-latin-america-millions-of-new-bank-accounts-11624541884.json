    "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO—The pandemic has pummeled Latin America and plunged many people into poverty. But the finance sector has reaped an unexpected windfall: Tens of millions in Latin America have opened banking accounts for the first time to store the emergency cash that governments handed out.<br />Emerging financial technology companies, including virtual banks that don’t have physical branches, are among the big winners. Cheaper and more nimble than ordinary banks but offering many of the same services, they are luring people who had long avoided traditional financial institutions.<br />More than 100 million people in a region of 650 million have shifted from a dependence on cash to new or dormant bank accounts during the pandemic, said the research firm Americas Market Intelligence in a report that  Mastercard  commissioned.<br />The effect has been particularly pronounced in Latin America because in Africa there was little stimulus spending to spur banking and in big Asian economies the percentage of people with accounts was already high.<br />The trend means millions can start saving money more easily than if they were stashing cash under the mattress, according to economists. An account also translates to easier access to credit and insurance, allowing people to start businesses in a region known for its large informal economy, they say."
