    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration has committed to help rebuild Gaza after the devastation of the recent Mideast conflict, but without providing any support to Hamas, which governs the territory and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and its allies.<br />The U.S. plans to address that challenge by channeling aid through a U.N. agency that frequently faces accusations of bias by supporters on all sides of the longstanding conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.<br />The Democratic administration of President Biden plans to restore funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, after the Republican Trump administration cut off funding for the agency, saying the move would pressure Palestinians to engage in peace talks with Israel.<br />“Hamas is a terrorist organization; we’ve recognized that,” Mr. Biden said after the two sides announced a cease-fire last month, after 11 days of armed conflict, civilian casualties and property damage. “But that doesn’t mean we should not be in Gaza, rebuilding Gaza for all those innocent people who in fact have been hurt.”<br />Elizabeth Campbell, the U.N. agency’s Washington director, said the U.N. operates under a set of rules in Gaza that aim to keep engagement with Hamas to a minimum. Under those rules, the agency engages with Hamas officials at the lowest possible level, for the least amount of time."
