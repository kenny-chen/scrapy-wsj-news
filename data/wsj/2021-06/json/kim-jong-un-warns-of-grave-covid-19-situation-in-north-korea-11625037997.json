    "body": "SEOUL—Kim Jong Un said North Korea’s Covid-19 situation has become grave and admonished senior officials for lapses in the fight against the disease.<br />Mr. Kim, speaking at a Politburo meeting, didn’t specify what had gone wrong. North Korea has reported zero Covid-19 cases and tested more than 31,000 individuals, according to the World Health Organization’s latest figures.<br />But Mr. Kim accused officials of neglecting their duties to execute the country’s countermeasures to fight Covid-19, which caused an unspecified “crucial case,” according to a North Korean state-media report published on Wednesday. He also pointed to the “lack of ability and irresponsibility of cadres.” He blamed them for poor decision-making on scientific, technological and institutional fronts.<br />The combined failures have created a “great crisis in ensuring the security of the state and safety of the people,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying.<br />If health conditions inside North Korea have worsened, Mr. Kim is likely to be looking for scapegoats and may be seeking political cover for accepting Covid-19 vaccines from overseas, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul."
