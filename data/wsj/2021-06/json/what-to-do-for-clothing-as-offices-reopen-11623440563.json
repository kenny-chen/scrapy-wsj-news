    "body": "As a professional working woman who has been back at the office since July 2020 and definitely not in sweats, I have wondered why the focus in the Journal over the past year has been proper attire for Zoom meetings (“You’re Going Back to the Office. What Are You Going to Wear?,” Exchange, June 5).<br />At my workplace we have delighted each other by getting “dressed up.” It’s been a colorful year, with coordinating face masks, exotic eyes and even tie-dye hair for a brave few. Once we are fully mask free, I am looking forward to adding lipstick to my morning routine again.<br />Beth Halliday<br />Maplewood, N.J.<br />For tens of millions of us the debate is settled. We will daily don our uniforms, coveralls and work clothes and, so bedecked, continue to keep the electricity and water on, deliver the mail and packages, truck goods across the county, stock the food stores, staff the hospitals and clinics, answer calls for emergency services, fix things, clean up messes and repair the roads. In short, do all the things we have been doing all along that can’t be accomplished via Zoom in a germ-proof home bunker. So go ahead and wear a suit jacket with a hoodie. Most of us will be too busy to notice."
