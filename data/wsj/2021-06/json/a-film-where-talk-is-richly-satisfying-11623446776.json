    "body": "<br /><br />Can dialogue-driven films be as cinematic as those featuring, say, battle scenes, car chases or epic vistas? Alfred Hitchcock didn’t think so. “I’m not against movies that talk, that photograph people talking—they’re a kind of movie,” Hitchcock told Peter Bogdanovich in an interview. “But they’re not motion pictures.”<br />Notwithstanding the opinion of the Master of Suspense, there are plenty of films that are talky without being stagy—from “The Seventh Seal” to “All About Eve.” One particularly striking example of the cinematic possibilities offered by dialogue-heavy films is Louis Malle’s “My Dinner With André” (1981), which consists of a talk-fueled late-evening meal at a New York restaurant between the actor-playwright Wallace Shawn and the stage director André Gregory (who co-wrote the screenplay).<br />The premise, for which the real-life friends mined their own conversations, doesn’t seem to lend itself to visual expressiveness, but Malle made directorial choices that enlivened, amplified and transformed what could have been a monotonous duologue."
