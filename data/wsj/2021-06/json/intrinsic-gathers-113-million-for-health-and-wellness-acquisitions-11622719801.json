    "body": "Startup Intrinsic Brands Inc. has raised $113 million in equity and debt to buy health-and-wellness goods sold online, adding to a spurt of venture investment in companies aggregating e-commerce products.<br />A proliferation of small businesses selling goods to consumers through  Amazon . com Inc. has led to the creation of startups looking to buy small brands and pump up their online sales.<br />Boston-based Whele LLC, better-known as Perch, for example, formed in 2019 and has raised more than $900 million, from SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and others, to acquire Amazon third-party and other direct-to-consumer brands. Perch sells products in categories including apparel and beauty, home and kitchen, and health and wellness.<br />New York-based Intrinsic is betting its sector expertise will convince many small-business owners in the health-and-wellness category that it is the best fit for their products, including ones sold over-the-counter for pregnancy and baby care, eye care and healthy aging. The Food and Drug Administration regulates the ingredients in these products, their manufacturing, and claims companies make on their labels, said Yadin Shemmer, Intrinsic’s co-founder and chief executive.<br />“The industry we’re in has a few very unique characteristics we think require specialization,” Mr. Shemmer said."
