    "body": "Royal Philips NV has recalled millions of sleep apnea and ventilator machines over concerns that a type of foam used in the devices could degrade and release harmful, possibly cancer-causing, particles.<br />The recall affects three million to four million machines, more than half of which are in the U.S., a company spokesman said Monday. About 80% are machines for aiding people with sleep apnea, a condition that causes a person to stop breathing for short periods during sleep. The rest are life-supporting mechanical ventilators.<br />Philips said after receiving a small number of patient complaints it was concerned that a type of foam used to dampen the machinesâ€™ sound may degrade into particles that are swallowed or inhaled by the user. These particles could cause headaches or breathing problems and might be carcinogenic, the company said, adding that gases released by the foam could also be harmful.<br />Philips said it had received no reports of death as a result of these issues.<br />The Amsterdam-based company said patients using the sleep apnea devices, known as BiPaP and CPAP, should stop treatment and seek an alternative if possible. Those on life-supporting ventilation should in general continue to use the device, as harm from withdrawal could outweigh the risks of the foam particles, it said."
