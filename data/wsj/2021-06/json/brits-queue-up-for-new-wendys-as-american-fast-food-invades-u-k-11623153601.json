    "body": "Wendy’s Co.  is returning to the U.K. two decades after it left, part of an American fast-food-chain invasion that has been a rare bright spot for restaurant property owners during the pandemic.<br />Wendy’s opened a restaurant in the town of Reading, 40 miles west of London, last week. The company, which left the country in 2001 complaining of high operating costs, said it would open in east London and the university city of Oxford this year. It plans to open hundreds of restaurants in the next several years, according to a company spokesman.<br />The hamburger chain known for its square patties joins a string of other U.S. fast-food operators including fried-chicken chain Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, which said it plans to open its first restaurant in London this year and eventually some 350 restaurants around the country.<br />Lemon Pepper Holdings Ltd., the London-based franchisee of Dallas chicken chain  Wingstop Inc.,  said it plans to double its number of British outlets to 20 by the end of this year.<br />Fast-food brands with expansion plans are benefiting from a glut of available sites. One in five city center casual dining restaurants—which offer table service but are less formal than fine dining—closed during the pandemic, according to trade association UK Hospitality."
