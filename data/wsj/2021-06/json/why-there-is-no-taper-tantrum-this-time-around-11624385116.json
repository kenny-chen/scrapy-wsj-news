    "body": "The taper tantrum has become taper tranquility.<br />When Federal Reserve officials started talking about pulling back on the central bank’s easy-money policies back in 2013, anxious investors sent markets into a tizzy. Yields on Treasury bonds rose, emerging-markets stocks tumbled, junk bond prices fell and stock volatility jumped, all in what came to be known as a market “taper tantrum” that preoccupied the Fed for months and played a role in delaying its plans.<br />The opposite is happening now: The Fed signaled it has begun discussions of reducing bond-purchase programs launched during the Covid-19 pandemic, and investors are placid. Emerging-markets stocks are up 5% this year, yields on junk bonds have fallen and stock volatility has diminished. The markets, in short, are taking everything in stride.<br />“I have been kind of worried for the last few months that at some point the market was going to get the idea that the accommodation was going to be withdrawn sooner than expected and it was going to become an issue,” said Jeremy Stein, a Harvard University economics professor and former Fed governor.<br />The fact that it didn’t happen is a puzzle with two possible explanations, one benign and the other problematic."
