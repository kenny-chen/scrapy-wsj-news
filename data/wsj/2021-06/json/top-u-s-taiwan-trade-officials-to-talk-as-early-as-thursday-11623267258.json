    "body": "WASHINGTON—U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai plans to speak with her Taiwanese counterpart as early as Thursday as the two governments move to restart trade and investment talks that were suspended during the Trump administration, people familiar with the discussion said Wednesday.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinkendisclosed plans for the talks at a House committee on Monday.<br />The Trade and Investment Framework Agreement talks date back to the 1990s. They are as much about the symbolism of U.S.-Taiwan cooperation in the face of opposition from Beijing—which considers Taiwan a renegade province—as they are about economic issues.<br />The talks were discontinued under the Trump administration’s trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who considered Taiwan a mercantilist country that blocked U.S. imports. He also was focused on negotiating a broad trade deal with Beijing.<br />A spokesman for  Taiwan’s representative in the U.S. didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A USTR spokesman declined comment on  discussions between Ms. Tai and Taiwan’s John Deng."
