    "body": "Two Stanford graduate students on a smoke break in 2004 had an idea: a less lethal cigarette. Adam Bowen and James Monsees knew that people “smoke for the nicotine but die from the tar.” The pair set out to deliver a nicotine buzz without combustion and the 70 carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The firm Messrs. Bowen and Monsees founded, known now as Juul Labs, is among the most reviled enterprises in the country, accused of hooking teenagers on nicotine and castigated by trial lawyers, politicians, anti-tobacco groups and affluent parents.<br />Jamie Ducharme’s “Big Vape: The Incendiary Rise of Juul” is a capably reported and readable account of the company’s origins and current battles. Public-health experts were split between harm-reduction enthusiasts and anti-nicotine fundamentalists. Juul’s potent, smooth nicotine salt “kept smokers satisfied,” unlike weaker competitors, but nonsmokers who were “experimenting” could take a heavy hit. There were no long-term studies about the health effects of “vaping,” or inhaling vapor instead of smoke. But a 2015 study from Public Health England, which Ms. Ducharme, a writer for Time magazine, mentions, found that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than cigarettes.<br />Messrs. Bowen and Monsees built the company in fits and starts, and Juul ran ads in 2015 that made its device “look like an object of desire” for cool young adults. Juul dumped the ads and started running testimonials from former smokers, but that didn’t stop anti-tobacco groups from accusing the company of pitching its product to teenagers. If Juul “had a target on its back,” Ms. Ducharme writes, that’s because “it had put one there.”<br />Juul committed $30 million to youth prevention, removed most flavored offerings from convenience stores, hardened online age-verification, left social media, and endorsed raising the buying age to 21. All of this was received by groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids as insufficient, insincere or both, and maybe it was. But what would have been enough?<br />At times, Juul was caught coming and going. The company resisted hiring people with experience in the regulated tobacco industry, ostensibly out of contempt for Big Tobacco. Someone with that background might have helped the company avoid its advertising blunders and better manage e-cigarette regulation the Food and Drug Administration was writing. But then “the disruptor” Juul became “the co-conspirator,” Ms. Ducharme says, accepting in 2018 a $12.8 billion investment from cigarette-maker Altria, designed in part to lend Juul regulatory expertise."
