    "body": "DENVER—Sgt. Joe Unser stood in front of 46 police recruits here recently to train them on what he said was one of the most difficult actions they might one day have to take: stopping fellow officers from doing something wrong.<br />“I’ll run toward gunfire any day,” he told them. Confronting colleagues and superior officers is much harder, the 26-year veteran said, in a culture where supporting fellow men and women in blue is a prized value.<br />Since former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd last May in front of three colleagues, more police departments have begun training police officers to intervene when their fellow officers use excessive force or engage in other misconduct.<br />Many are using a training called Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement, or ABLE, that was designed by policing researchers at Georgetown University Law School based on studies of group violence by Ervin Staub, a Holocaust survivor and emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In the four years after the training was first tried in New Orleans in 2016, only a handful of departments signed up.<br />“Fewer than a dozen expressed interest and one or two took the curriculum,” said Lisa Kurtz, ABLE project director at Georgetown. “In June of last year, I personally received emails from more than 100 agencies across the country.”"
