    "body": "Shopping online can feel like magic. A couple of clicks and a few days later, a box is on your doorstep. But it can also feel like playing a game of digital dodgeball. Shoppers must tread carefully to avoid the fake reviews, unsafe or mislabeled products, or counterfeit goods hiding behind legitimate-seeming listings.<br />That’s because we are living in the Marketplace Era. Third-party sellers peddle their wares via the digital bazaars of  Amazon ,   Walmart ,  Target—and now even Urban Outfitters and J.Crew. The deal could be seen as a win-win: Customers get a larger selection of products and retailers get a cut of more sales. The problem? It adds a layer of mystery for shoppers. Instead of buying from that site you know, you’re buying from a seller you don’t know, and often it’s a product whose brand you’ve never heard of.<br />Plus, policies for returns and refunds might be different than items sold directly by the site. Most don’t vet third-party products for quality.
