    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Democrats said they were considering changes to their election overhaul proposal, after pivotal centrist Sen. Joe Manchin made clear he opposed both the current bill and any imminent move to weaken Republicans’ power to block legislation.<br />“We’re open to changes and modifications as long as it does the job,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). He added that “we’ve had discussions with Sen. Manchin and they’re continuing.”<br />The voting measure touches on nearly every aspect of the election system, from how districts are drawn, to how campaigns are financed, to how voters register and verify their eligibility.<br />Mr. Schumer spoke after Senate Democrats met behind closed doors at a weekly lunch at which the impasse was a central topic. Mr. Manchin has called the current bill, the For the People Act or S-1, too partisan and said any changes to election law should have support from both parties. He missed the gathering, and a Manchin spokeswoman said he had a conflicting meeting.<br />Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), the Democratic whip, said members had a candid conversation during Tuesday’s lunch. “There’s a lot of strong feelings about that bill,” he said, adding that most members felt it was necessary and popular. “But we’re waiting to see how Sen. Manchin is going to react.”"
