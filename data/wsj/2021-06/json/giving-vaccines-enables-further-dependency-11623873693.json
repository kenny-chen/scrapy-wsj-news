    "body": "“U.S. to Donate 500 Million Vaccine Doses” (U.S. News, June 10) presents a clear picture of President Biden’s meek response to the global Covid-19 pandemic. He declares that America can muster only hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for a world population of over seven billion people.<br />Without a longer-term plan for self-sufficiency, developing countries will remain dependent on wealthier countries, and the U.S. taxpayer, for vaccine donations. By facilitating infrastructure development and funding streams, patent waivers lead to greater stability and independence among developing countries. President Biden was right to pursue patent waivers at the World Trade Organization, yet he cannot gain the support of European allies to create a more permanent solution to vaccine distribution.<br />Vaccine diplomacy will define President Biden’s presidency. Trying to “out donate” the Chinese or Russians isn’t a winning approach. An aligned strategy that creates independence among the most afflicted countries in the world will result in greater global stability and health. If the U.S. is indeed back, as President Biden declares, then he must persuade his European partners to work together at the WTO and create a permanent solution to vaccine development and distribution.<br />Nao Matsukata<br />Bethesda, Md."
