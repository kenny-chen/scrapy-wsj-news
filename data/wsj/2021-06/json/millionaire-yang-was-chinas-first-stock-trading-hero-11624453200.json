    "body": "“Millionaire Yang” embodied Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping’s mantra “To get rich is glorious.”<br />A steelworker-turned-winning-investor whose real name was Yang Huaiding, he became a folk hero with his stock trading at the dawn of China’s financial-market experiments in the late 1980s.<br />Millionaire Yang, as he was widely known, died June 13 in Shanghai, official media outlets in China reported.<br />He was 70 years old, according to the birth date given in his 2002 autobiography, “How to Be a Millionaire,” which said he grew up poor in a large Shanghai family. His father once worked in the local tax bureau while his mother did social work.<br />China’s state-controlled news agency, Xinhua, quoted a son, Yang Yuqi, saying Mr. Yang had been hospitalized for complications related to diabetes."
