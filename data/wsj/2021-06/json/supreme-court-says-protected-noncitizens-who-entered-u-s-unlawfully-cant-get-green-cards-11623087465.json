    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court said Monday that noncitizens who entered the U.S. unlawfully can’t obtain permanent residency even if the government has permitted them to stay under temporary protected status.<br />The unanimous opinion, written by Justice Elena Kagan, said current immigration law only permits those who were admitted lawfully to the U.S. to apply for permanent residency.<br />Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, defers the deportation of noncitizens when conditions in their home countries make it too dangerous to return.<br />The court returned the issue to Congress, noting that pending legislation would explicitly authorize TPS recipients who entered unlawfully to seek green cards; the American Dream and Promise Act, which passed the House in March with support from all Democrats and a handful of Republicans, now awaits action in the Senate.<br />For now, at least, people like Jose Santos Sanchez, a Salvadoran who came to the U.S. illegally in the 1990s, are out of luck. In 2001, the George W. Bush administration granted protected status to Salvadorans then in the U.S. after El Salvador was struck by a series of devastating earthquakes, and that status was repeatedly renewed."
