    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former White House counsel Don McGahn testified Friday in a long-running Democrat-led congressional investigation into whether former President Donald Trump obstructed justice while in office.<br />Mr. McGahn, who served as the top legal adviser to Mr. Trump for the early part of his presidency and was a key witness in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, appeared for a closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill before the House Judiciary Committee.<br />Under a deal struck last month that ended a two-year legal battle over whether he was required to appear before Congress under subpoena, Mr. McGahn had been set to testify about matters referenced in the public portion of Mr. Mueller’s report. A transcript of his testimony is likely to be released next week, lawmakers said.<br />Mr. McGahn was initially ordered to testify by the Democrat-led House Judiciary committee in April 2019. Though he had already left government service by then, the White House said Mr. McGahn couldn’t appear because close presidential advisers had absolute immunity from being compelled to testify.<br />While courts have long recognized that the executive branch can keep some of its internal discussions confidential, no court had blessed an interpretation of privilege that would make Mr. McGahn completely immune from appearing before Congress."
