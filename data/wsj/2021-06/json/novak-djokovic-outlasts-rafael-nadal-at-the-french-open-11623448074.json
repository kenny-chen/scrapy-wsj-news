    "body": "PARIS—France had lived under various pandemic restrictions for 16 months before Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic took the court at Roland-Garros on Friday night. But nearly four hours into one of the most epic tennis matches in recent memory—right as the country’s 11 p.m. curfew threatened to send a frenzied crowd home—French authorities did the most French thing imaginable: they made an exception.<br />The 5,000 fans here would be allowed to remain in their seats for the duration of the match. The tennis was just too good.<br />Within an hour, the lucky 5,000 had witnessed instant tennis history, a Nadal defeat on the clay courts of Paris. The 13-time champion, increasingly hobbled by ankle trouble during the match, went down at the French Open for only the third time in his career, in a 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-2 loss to Djokovic, the world No. 1.<br />“It was certainly the greatest match I’ve ever played in Paris,” Djokovic said in French on court.<br />Until Friday night, Nadal had taken 105 of his 107 matches here, a record that seemed hardly possible in modern sports. The last time Nadal failed to win the tournament was when he pulled out of the 2016 event in the third round. The previous time he actually lost a match was a 2015 quarterfinal defeat in straight sets to Djokovic."
