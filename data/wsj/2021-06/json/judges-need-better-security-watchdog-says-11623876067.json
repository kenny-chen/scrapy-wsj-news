    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Marshals Service has neither the capabilities nor the resources to adequately protect federal judges at a time when threats against them have skyrocketed, according to a government watchdog report released Wednesday.<br />The Justice Department’s inspector general found an array of judicial-security challenges and shortcomings at the Marshals Service, which is charged with protecting 2,700 judges, as well as federal prosecutors and other court officials.<br />The report said resource limitations and competing budget priorities have impeded the Marshals Service’s ability to provide the level of protective services needed. It also found the Marshals Service isn’t sufficiently monitoring the current threat landscape, which has shifted to online and social-media settings.<br />The number of threats targeting judges and other protected personnel in the 2020 fiscal year was up 81% compared with 2016, the report said.<br />“The U.S. Marshals Service does not have the resources or proactive threat detection capabilities it needs to meet its important mission to protect federal judges, courts, and judicial employees,” Inspector General Michael Horowitz said."
