    "body": "The National Collegiate Athletic Association once had the tightest of clamps on college athlete compensation, maintaining a strict stance that any form of benefit that rewarded players for their participation would wreck a so-called “amateur model” that it had relied on for decades.<br />As the NCAA meets on Tuesday to determine a new vision for college sports, however, its ironclad hold on athlete compensation has been broken—and it has little leverage to retake control of the matter.<br />The Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Monday that the NCAA had violated antitrust law in a case about the range of permitted education-related benefits that college athletes can receive. In the future, the NCAA will now be subject to the same kind of scrutiny as other entities as to whether its rules unlawfully suppress competition. It can’t fall back on arguments that maintaining an amateur model is crucial to its product.<br />“The NCAA is on its heels right now,” said Len Elmore, co-chair of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, an advocacy group that aims to reform inequities in college sports.<br />The decision marks a historic loss of control for an organization that for decades has maintained a narrow view of how athletes are compensated for playing college sports—and wielded a powerful enforcement club at those who violated them. It held the power to vacate titles and remove wins."
