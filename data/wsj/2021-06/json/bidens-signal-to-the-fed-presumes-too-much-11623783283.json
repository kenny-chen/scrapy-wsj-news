    "body": "Your editorial about the Fed and President Biden’s budget (“Biden’s Budget Signal to the Fed,” June 3) reports on “the message President Biden is sending to the Fed: His agenda requires that the central bank keep interest rates abnormally low, even below the inflation rate, for the entire Biden Presidency.” But the Fed can’t do this.<br />Interest rates are set in global capital markets. For all its powers, the Fed is one player in this market. We’ve seen low rates because capital demand has been low and capital supply has been high. While the Fed can lower rates in the short run, it can’t keep them below their natural levels for an entire presidential administration.<br />Your point about the Fed indirectly financing budget deficits is much stronger. Economists call this fiscal dominance: spending authorities forcing the monetary authorities to underwrite perpetual deficits. The usual result is uncomfortably high inflation. While it’s too early to worry about 1970s-style misery, those troubles aren’t out of the question.<br />Alexander William Salter<br />Texas Tech University"
