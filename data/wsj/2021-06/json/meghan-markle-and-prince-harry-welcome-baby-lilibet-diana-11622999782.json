    "body": "LONDON—Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had a daughter, their second child, and named her Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor.<br />Lilibet, or Lili, was born on Friday at 11:40 a.m. local time at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., according to a statement on the website of the couple’s Archewell organization.<br />The baby, a younger sister for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s 2-year-old son, Archie, weighed 7 pounds and 11 ounces. She will be eighth in line for the throne after her grandfather, Prince Charles, Harry’s brother William and his three children, and Harry himself and her elder brother.<br />Both mother and child are healthy and well, and settling in at home, the couple said.<br />The birth comes at a time of strained relations between the Sussexes and the U.K. royal family. The couple quit as working royals last year and relocated to the U.S. to escape press intrusion and allegations of racism in the royal ranks, which senior family members deny."
