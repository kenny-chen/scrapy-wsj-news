    "body": "Centene Corp.  said it settled claims from Ohio and Mississippi related to its pharmacy-benefit billing practices, and it is setting aside $1.1 billion to resolve similar issues with other states.<br />The big managed-care company said it would pay about $88 million to Ohio and $55 million to Mississippi. Ohio’s attorney general, Dave Yost, sued the company in March, alleging that it had misled the state’s Medicaid program about its pharmacy-related costs, resulting in overpayments by the state.<br />“Centene took advantage of all of us who pay taxes to care for the most vulnerable Ohioans,” he said in a release Monday.<br />Mississippi’s attorney general and auditor investigated similar issues, though the state hadn’t sued Centene. They said in a news release that the settlement “resolves allegations of overpayments as a part of Mississippi’s Medicaid program.”<br />Centene, which is based in St. Louis, said it admitted no fault in the settlements and denies any liability for the practices that the states examined. The company said that the issues that the states focused on occurred “primarily during 2017 and 2018” and it has since restructured its pharmacy benefits operations."
