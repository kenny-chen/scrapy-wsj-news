    "body": "Public-health officials and leaders in developing-world countries are expected to press the Group of Seven countries to commit to large donations of Covid-19 vaccines and billions in financing at a summit later this week, saying the developing world needs more help to emerge from the worst of the pandemic.<br />High vaccination rates are helping wealthier nations recover from the health crisis, with coronavirus case numbers falling sharply and economies bouncing back.<br />But even as rich countries begin vaccinating low-risk people such as teenagers, many poor countries are far behind in their inoculation efforts, hobbling their economies and raising the risk that those regions could spawn more dangerous variants of the virus.<br />A number of rich countries, including the U.S., have pledged tens of millions of doses for poor nations. Nonetheless, pressure is building on the leaders of the G-7, which comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., to commit to doing more at a summit starting Friday in the U.K.<br />Officials in developing countries, as well as public-health authorities, are calling on G-7 leaders to donate millions of shots to bridge a perilous supply gap over the summer and keep vaccine rollouts from stalling altogether."
