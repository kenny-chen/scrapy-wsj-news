    "body": "“Ignorance and despotism seem made for each other,” wrote Thomas Jefferson. How shocked and dismayed he would be to read “The Filibuster Helps Nobody, and That Means You” (op-ed, June 21), Mike Solon and Bill Greene’s paean to legislative paralysis and electorate indifference.<br />“Through the filibuster,” Messrs. Solon and Greene proudly announce, “Americans enjoy the unique freedom not to be politically active.” Their utopia is a comatose, distracted society where indifferent constituents while away their time “playing, praying, fishing, tailgating” and so on, and pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. No worries about the duty of citizens to be politically active, or at least aware. Perhaps Jefferson should have said, “Democracy—use it or lose it.”<br />Lou Race<br />Los Angeles<br />"
