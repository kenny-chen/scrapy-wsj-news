    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Threats Rise, Defense Falls” (June 16): President Biden says “America is back”—back to reduced defense budgets despite increased global threats. The U.S. is also back to the Obama administration approach of making a budget and then forcing the military to prepare a strategy within it. I happen to believe in President Reagan’s approach: Complete a strategy based on the threat, then address the cost and trade-offs.<br />The Biden administration’s “divest to invest” strategy might make sense if it were true. Unfortunately, you can take it to the bank that the Biden administration has no intention of pursuing the “invest” part of the slogan, unless you count social-welfare initiatives as national-security investments. I count them as socialism.<br />Ron Sable<br />Tucson, Ariz.<br />Mr. Sable was special assistant to the president for national security affairs (1985-88)."
