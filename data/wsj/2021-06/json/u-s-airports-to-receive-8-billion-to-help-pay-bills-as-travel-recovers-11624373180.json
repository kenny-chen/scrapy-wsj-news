    "body": "U.S. airports are set to receive $8 billion in government grants to help them emerge from the coronavirus pandemic that decimated travel last year.<br />Air travel is returning, but airports say they are still grappling with lower traffic volumes, high debt payments and new costs stemming from the pandemic.<br />The grants announced by the Federal Aviation Administration Tuesday, which were included in the $1.9 trillion stimulus package approved in March, will help ease financial burdens until travel fully recovers, airports say.<br />Airports can use the fresh round of funds to cover operating costs, to pay debt service, or for new expenses related to preventing the spread of disease, like installing air filters or stepping up cleaning practices. Funding levels are based largely on an airport’s 2019 traffic, with some money earmarked to cover rent payments for concessions operators. Airports must also commit to keeping 90% of employees as a condition of accepting the funds.<br />Leisure travelers have flooded back into airports in recent months. Some 2.1 million people passed through U.S. airport security screening Sunday, the highest number since the pandemic began to decimate air travel in March 2020, according to the Transportation Security Administration."
