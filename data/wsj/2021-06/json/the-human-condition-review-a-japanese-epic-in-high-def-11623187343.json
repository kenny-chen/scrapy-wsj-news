    "body": "<br /><br />Japanese cinema has historically been rife with epic tales inspired by literature, many set in the distant past. But none has attained the overwhelming emotional impact of Masaki Kobayashi’s “The Human Condition,” based on a six-volume novel by Jumpei Gomikawa and running 91/2  hours on screen. The film took some four years to complete and was first released in three installments of two parts each between 1959 and 1961. In 2009, the Criterion Collection brought it all to DVD, and the company has just  upgraded it to Blu-ray in a high-definition digital restoration on three discs.<br />Despite the presence of clashing armies, feudal discipline and questions of honor, “The Human Condition” is no samurai or swordplay film, but rather a crushing indictment of Japanese militarism and imperialism during the 1940s. Gomikawa’s sprawling novel appeared only a year before Kobayashi began his adaptation, yet the material spoke to the filmmaker—he co-wrote the screenplay with Zenzo Matsuyama—in a singular way.<br />Like Kaji, the protagonist in both novel and film, Kobayashi regarded himself as a pacificist and a socialist. And also, like Kaji, he was forced to join the army during World War II; didn’t pursue a rank higher than private, though he could have; and was made a prisoner of war near the conflict’s end."
