    "body": "HONG KONG—Chinese officials said mismanagement and negligence by local officials and the operators of a 60-mile ultramarathon in the country’s western mountains led to the deaths of 21 runners last month.<br />The death toll among participants in the Yellow River Stone Forest Ultramarathon was among the worst in mountain sports—exceeding even devastating climbing accidents including the 1991 Kawagarbo avalanche that killed 17—and shocked the country.<br />Five people affiliated with the Gansu Jingsheng Sports Co., the race’s operator, have been arrested and will face criminal charges, investigators said at a news conference Friday. Two local officials will face discipline by China’s Communist Party, while more than a dozen more have been sacked or demoted, the investigators said.<br />The investigators also confirmed the death of  Li Zuobi, party secretary of Jingtai County, which co-hosted the race. Investigators said he shouldered primary responsibility for the tragedy.<br />The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported Mr. Li died falling from his high-rise apartment building Wednesday morning after being visited by Communist Party discipline officials earlier that day, according to people familiar with the matter. A state-run magazine, Western China Development, in a social media post Thursday cited local officials in reporting that Mr. Li’s death had been a suicide."
