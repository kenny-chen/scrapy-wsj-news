    "body": "A surge of retirements during the pandemic is scrambling the Federal Reserve’s plans for taking the U.S. economy off life support.<br />“This is an extraordinarily unusual time, and we really don’t have a template of any experiences of a situation like this,” said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in a press conference Wednesday following the central bank’s June meeting. “We have to be humble about our ability to understand the data.”<br />Throughout the pandemic, officials have emphasized that they were likely to hold interest rates near zero until the labor market returns to full employment, when everyone who wants a job can find one without pushing inflation up uncontrollably.<br />Full employment has always been notoriously hard to measure, but now it has gotten harder still. Officials look at a range of indicators, including the number of jobs created and the share of the adult population either working or looking for a job.<br />The rapid rise in retirements translates to fewer people available to work—meaning the labor market could hit the full employment threshold at lower levels of employment and a lower labor-force participation rate than before the pandemic."
