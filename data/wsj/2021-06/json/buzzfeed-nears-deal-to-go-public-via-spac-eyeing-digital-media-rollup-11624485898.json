BuzzFeed is vying for greater scale to better compete for online ad dollars with tech giants such as  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google,  Amazon . com Inc. and  Facebook Inc.<br />The Information earlier reported on BuzzFeed’s plans to buy rivals, including Complex Networks, as a public company.<br />The deal to take BuzzFeed public marks a turning point for Mr. Peretti, a onetime schoolteacher who parlayed his affinity for stunts that went viral on the internet into a winding career as a digital-media entrepreneur. The 47-year-old executive helped found HuffPost alongside Arianna Huffington in 2005 and began work on BuzzFeed in a small workspace in New York’s Chinatown neighborhood in 2006."
