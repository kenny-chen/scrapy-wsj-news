    "body": "‘Trust, but verify,” President Reagan liked to say when I was coming of age in the 1980s. I swore I’d abide by his wisdom. How strange, then, to look up as a middle-aged man—an attorney, no less—and realize how many phrases in everyday life I’ve left utterly unexamined. This ends now.<br />Never again shall I stand down when my impertinent neighbor assures me he can no longer do something disagreeable to me in good conscience. He hasn’t forsworn the activity, and may well persist in dumping mowed-grass clippings over the fence and into my yard, just not without a troubled mind.<br />Nor shall I accept a politician promising she will not stand idly by while, for instance, noxious legislation is proposed. Her plan might be to stand by other than idly and still sleep the sleep of the righteous. Adverbs are notorious weasel words, able to make a sentence mean whatever it needs to mean, essentially.<br />If a clothier that undertook to ship me a sweater hasn’t done so when promised, I’ll be ready when customer service swears they’ll redouble their efforts. Double nothing and you still have nothing.<br />If opposing counsel hints at willingness to settle a dispute for a fraction of any amount I contemplate, I won’t visualize any “found money” trophy, in case that fraction is greater than one. I’ll also look askance at advice from anyone who’s faced an issue any number of times, zero being a number."
