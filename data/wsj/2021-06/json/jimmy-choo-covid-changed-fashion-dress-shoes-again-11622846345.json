    "body": "Legendary designer Jimmy Choo parted ways with the company that bears his name two decades ago. But he continues to ply his craft, designing couture gowns, shoes and a new bridal collection. At the same time, he serves as a tourism ambassador for his native Malaysia and is launching a London fashion school to educate young designers.<br />Mr. Choo recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal about how Covid-19 changed the fashion industry, what motivates him to keep designing, and whether people will dress up again. The following are edited excerpts from the conversation.<br />WSJ: What has it been like showing your collections online instead of on a runway? Do you think the industry will revert to its old ways once the pandemic fades?<br />Mr. Choo: In the last year, we did one digital show. I believe, as Covid slowly dies down, we will go back to the fashion runways. People like to hear the music and see the models. In digital, the feel is different. I think the real shows will come back.<br />WSJ: The pandemic ushered in a shift to more casual dressing. Do people still want to dress up?"
