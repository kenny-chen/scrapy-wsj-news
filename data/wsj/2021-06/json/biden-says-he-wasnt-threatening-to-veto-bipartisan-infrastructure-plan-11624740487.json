    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden walked back comments tying the fate of a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure agreement to a separate, Democratic effort to pass a broad antipoverty plan, recommitting to the bipartisan deal after Republicans threatened to withdraw their support.<br />Mr. Biden said Saturday that his earlier comments “created the impression that I was issuing a veto threat” on his proposal, “which was certainly not my intent.”<br />“The bottom line is this: I gave my word to support the Infrastructure Plan, and that’s what I intend to do. I intend to pursue the passage of that plan, which Democrats and Republicans agreed to on Thursday, with vigor,” he said in a statement. Mr. Biden will travel to Wisconsin on Tuesday to discuss the merits of the agreement, according to a White House official.<br />The statement marked a reversal by the president in a bid to preserve bipartisanship support of the infrastructure deal that his comments had cast into doubt.<br />After reaching an agreement with a bipartisan group of senators on the infrastructure plan earlier this week, Mr. Biden had said he wouldn’t sign the infrastructure deal if Congress didn’t also pass a multitrillion-dollar package focused on childcare, education, and other Democratic priorities paid for with tax increases on corporations and high-income Americans."
