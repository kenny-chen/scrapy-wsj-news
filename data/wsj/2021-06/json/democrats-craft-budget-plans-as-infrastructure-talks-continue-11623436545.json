    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senior Democrats said they hoped to pass budget resolutions by the end of July, teeing up for late summer and early fall a package that could determine the scope of President Biden’s legislative ambitions on infrastructure and social programs.<br />At the same time, Congress will likely have to juggle key spending bills and legislation to raise the country’s borrowing limit, aligning must-pass legislation with a period of high-stakes internal negotiations.<br />In an interview this week, House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D., Ky.) said he was working on a fiscal year 2022 budget resolution that he hoped to send to the House floor for a vote by the end of July. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) said he hoped “we can get it done by then” as well.<br />Although the budget blueprint is typically a largely symbolic document, it holds unusual significance this year. It is the necessary first step if Democrats want to pass all or part of Mr. Biden’s infrastructure and anti-poverty proposals without GOP support.<br />Senate Democrats said this week they were moving forward with a process tied to the budget known as reconciliation that allows them to pass legislation with just a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes most bills require."
