    "body": "SEOUL—Kim Jong Un said his country will prepare for both diplomacy and confrontation with the U.S., the North Korean leader’s first public remarks signaling a willingness to resume nuclear negotiations since President Biden took office.<br />Mr. Kim’s comments were made during a speech at a plenary session of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party, a state-media report said Friday. Nuclear negotiations between the two countries have been stalled since 2019.<br />Administration officials reached out to Pyongyang early in Mr. Biden’s presidency to gauge the possibility of resuming negotiations. The U.S. leader has said he is open to diplomacy with North Korea, but Mr. Kim’s regime hadn’t yet responded in a meaningful way, U.S. officials have said.<br />“It had seemed like North Korea was keeping the door to diplomacy very close to shut,” said Wi Sung-lac, a former nuclear envoy for Seoul who has participated in negotiations with the Kim regime. “It now looks like the North Koreans have slightly opened the door, though not by a lot.”<br />The Biden administration conducted a policy review on North Korea, which it said in April had been completed. Since then, U.S. officials have said they would continue pressuring Mr. Kim to give up his entire nuclear arsenal, but wouldn’t seek a grand bargain as former President Donald Trump had."
