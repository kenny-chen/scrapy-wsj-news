    "body": "On the day the Brooklyn Nets became an NBA superteam by trading for James Harden, a player they might send back to the Houston Rockets was in his mother’s car finishing his math homework.<br />Josh Rivera had been driven to his basketball trainer’s gym for a workout by the time he peeked at a television and learned that his favorite player was now playing for one of his favorite teams.<br />“I was like, whaaaaaaaat?” he said.<br />It was hard to consider a world in which Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving were teammates and reach any other conclusion. But when the Nets instantly became title contenders by trading for Harden, they didn’t just swap players with the Rockets. They also paid a fortune in draft capital.<br />Harden cost the Nets the rights to their first-round picks through 2027—which means James Harden was traded for someone like Josh Rivera."
