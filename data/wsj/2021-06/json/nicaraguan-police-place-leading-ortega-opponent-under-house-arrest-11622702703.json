    "body": "Nicaraguan police placed Cristiana Chamorro, President Daniel Ortega’s most prominent opponent, under house arrest after searching her home for at least five hours in what her family said was the latest attempt to keep her from challenging Mr. Ortega in November presidential elections.<br />Ms. Chamorro, recently accused by prosecutors of money laundering, has emerged as the favorite among at least eight would-be candidates seeking to challenge Mr. Ortega. Nicaragua’s authoritarian president, in power since 2007, is expected to run for a fourth consecutive term.<br />“She is all right, but she can’t leave her house,” said Juan Sebastian Chamorro, a cousin and family spokesman. “She has been told she is under house arrest.”<br />“This is a totally irregular and illegal action,” said Mr. Chamorro, who is seeking the presidential nomination from the same opposition group as Ms. Chamorro. Polls show Ms. Chamorro leads the field by a wide margin.<br />Orietta Benavides, Ms. Chamorro’s lawyer, said police stormed the home minutes before a press conference Ms. Chamorro had called to claim irregularities in the case that Nicaraguan authorities are pressing against her."
