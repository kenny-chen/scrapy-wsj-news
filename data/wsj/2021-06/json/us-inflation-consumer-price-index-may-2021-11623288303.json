    "body": "U.S. consumer prices likely continued to rise rapidly in May as the economic recovery picked up, reflecting a surge in demand along with shortages of labor and materials.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate that the Labor Department will report that the consumer-price index increased by 4.7% in May from a year earlier, up from 4.2% for the year ended in April. That would be the highest 12-month inflation rate since 2008. The core-price index, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, likely rose 3.5% in May from a year before, they estimated.<br />They also projected that the index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in May from April. The index measures what consumers pay for goods and services, including clothes, groceries, restaurant meals, recreational activities and vehicles.<br />The annual inflation measurements are being boosted by comparisons with figures from last year during Covid-19 lockdowns, when prices plummeted because of collapsing demand for many goods and services. This so-called base effect is expected to push up inflation readings significantly in May and June, dwindling into the fall.<br />Compared with two years ago, overall prices rose a more muted 2.2% in April. Overall prices, however, jumped at a 7.2% annualized rate in the three months ended in April."
