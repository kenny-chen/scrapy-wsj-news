    "body": "In five months, Hobbs Kessler has gone from a largely unknown high school runner to national record holder to surprise competitor in the U.S. Olympic track and field trials.<br />As Kessler prepared for Thursday’s 1,500-meter preliminaries in Eugene, Ore., he was honest about what fueled his rise: a large dose of testosterone.<br />“I would say the biggest thing that helped me was going through puberty,” he said.<br />Kessler had other benefits besides the natural hormones that made him bigger and stronger. The Ann Arbor, Mich., 18-year-old has parents who coach and are accomplished athletes. Kessler honed his body and focus by rock climbing. And he runs with an elite training group guided by a 77-year-old Marine Corps Vietnam veteran.<br />Kessler’s talent is “probably the best I’ve ever coached,” said Ron Warhurst, who worked at the University of Michigan for more than three decades in track and cross-country running. “And I’ve coached nine Olympians, numerous NCAA champions.”"
