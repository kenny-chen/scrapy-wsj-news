They won’t lose applicants over cost increases. Parents who can’t pay will expect the feds to step in. As a result, the next generation of students will be met with the same or worse debt problems, causing another student-loan cancellation initiative. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, every dollar in subsidized loans results in a 60-cent increase in the sticker price of college tuition.<br />To break this vicious circle, the government needs to lower tuition costs by getting out of the credit market for student loans and developing a more cost-effective way for all Americans, regardless of income, to attend college. The government could promote community colleges and trade schools over the traditional university experience, for example. Then the discussion can begin on how to deal with existing student debt."
