    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden revoked a Trump-era attempt to ban Chinese-owned apps TikTok and  WeChat ,  substituting Wednesday an executive  order mandating a broad review of apps controlled by foreign adversaries to determine whether they pose a security threat to the U.S.<br />The new order doesn’t target any companies specifically, but creates the potential for an even broader crackdown on Chinese-owned apps than the Trump administration orders it replaces by mandating a review of all software applications with potential ties to countries such as China.<br />The Commerce Department was authorized to begin that review immediately, the White House said.<br />The executive order is designed to replace the Trump administration’s approach targeting individual companies with a broader process for reviewing risks posed by foreign-owned apps, according to senior Biden administration officials. The officials say the executive orders signed by former President Donald Trump were effectively unenforceable.<br />The officials say they remain concerned about security risks from Chinese and certain other foreign-owned apps, but that the executive orders signed by former President Donald Trump were effectively unenforceable."
