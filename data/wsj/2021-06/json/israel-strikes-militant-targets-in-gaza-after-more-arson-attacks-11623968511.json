    "body": "JERUSALEM—The Israeli military hit the Gaza Strip with a series of airstrikes Thursday night, rattling a shaky month-old cease-fire between the two sides that mediators are trying to keep from falling apart.<br />Soon after, for the first time in nearly a month, air raid sirens sounded the alarm in southern Israel when Gaza militants used heavy machine guns to fire across the border, the Israeli military said.<br />There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths, but the escalating violence threatens to unravel the tenuous May 21 truce that brought an end to 11 days of fighting that killed more than 250 people in Gaza and 13 others in Israel.<br />Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, the Israeli military’s chief of staff, directed the nation’s forces to prepare for the possibility the truce could crumble.<br />Gen. Kochavi told his forces to prepare “for a variety of scenarios including a resumption of hostilities, in the face of continuing terror activities from the Gaza Strip,” the Israeli military said."
