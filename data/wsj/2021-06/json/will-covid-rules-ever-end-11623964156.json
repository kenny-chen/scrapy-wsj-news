    "body": "The Covid emergency is over and this week even governors who have been the most hostile to liberty and good sense are rescinding many of their most destructive orders. Unfortunately the unhealthy desire to issue Covid diktats without a careful study of costs and benefits is not limited to politicians.<br />As for the good news of the day, Craig Mauger and Beth LeBlanc report for the Detroit News on a long overdue announcement:<br />But as in other “reopening” states, some government rules remain. And even outside of government, the desire to issue Covid orders is still alive and well. There’s an important debate to be had about pending rules from businesses and schools. Perhaps social media companies will allow it to occur on their platforms. Harvard Medical School’s Martin Kulldorff announces today on Twitter:<br />In the op-ed which Silicon Valley firms may or may not be willing to show to consumers, the Harvard prof and Stanford University’s Dr. Jay Bhattacharya write that the “idea that everyone must be vaccinated against COVID-19 is as misguided as the anti-vax idea that no one should.” They add:<br />But the two professors warn against mandating a Covid vaccine for children who face little risk from the virus, because even a relatively safe vaccine carries some small risk of an adverse event, and in this case it may be greater than the small risk young people face from Covid."
