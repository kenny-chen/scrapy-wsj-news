    "body": "SALT LAKE CITY—First lady Jill Biden used a recent appearance at a Utah middle school to call for more education spending and to emphasize safely reopening schools in the pandemic, points she says she repeatedly makes to her husband.<br />The remarks showcased one of the issues Dr. Biden has made a priority in the first five months of the administration, along with community colleges, visiting military families and cancer research, as she also carries out the more ceremonial duties of the presidential spouse.<br />In the past few days, she has accompanied President Biden to Europe, met with Queen Elizabeth, held events with military veterans and played on the beach with the young child of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie.<br />Many of her activities have pushed the president’s policy agenda, especially on education. She has wooed key Democratic constituencies such as teachers and union members in visits to at least 21 states.<br />In Salt Lake City, Dr. Biden said her husband was committed to increasing federal funding for schools, citing the need to attract more teachers of color and to pay teachers competitive salaries. Teachers, she said, need resources, adding: “Your president knows that. After all, he’s married to me and I tell him nearly every day.”"
