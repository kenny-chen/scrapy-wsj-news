    "body": "New York City mayoral candidates came out swinging in the final Democratic debate before the June 22 primary, lacing into one another over their plans for reducing crime and improving quality of life after the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Thursday night’s televised debate featured the top eight Democratic candidates and capped weeks of intense campaigning and attacks on the front-runners. The candidates made their pitch for why they should lead the city while taking flak from their opponents.<br />When asked about street homelessness, former presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang said he believed there should be more psychiatric-ward beds for those who need it. City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who has highlighted his government experience while campaigning, ridiculed Mr. Yang for not having any sense of the cost of such a plan.<br />“That is the greatest non-answer I’ve ever heard in all of our debates,” he said. “Not one specific idea, not one specific plan.”<br />Throughout the two-hour debate, the candidates tried to differentiate themselves on a range of topics, from the desegregation of schools to affordable housing."
