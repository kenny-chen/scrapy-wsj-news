    "body": "Nike Inc.  posted record quarterly sales, topping $12 billion for the first time in its 50-year history, on pent-up U.S. consumer demand for sneakers and sportswear this spring.<br />Revenue in the May ended quarter nearly doubled to $12.34 billion from $6.31 billion a year ago, when sales were depressed by the spread of Covid-19. Nike’s direct sales—those items ordered through its apps, websites or own stores—climbed 73% to $4.5 billion.<br />Shares jumped 12% in after-hours trading, as the sales and profits were better than Wall Street had forecast. Nike’s net income was $1.5 billion, compared with a net loss of $790 million in the year ago quarter.<br />“These are times when strong brands can get stronger, and each quarter, this reality becomes even more clear,” said CEO John Donahoe on a call Thursday with analysts.<br />During the pandemic, many professional and youth sports were halted. Nike temporarily closed its retail stores and continued to pay its workers, and doubled down on digital sales while consumers were confined to their homes."
