    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Ireland’s Tax Lesson for Biden” (May 28) and the letters of June 7: Ireland’s experience using an aggressively low corporate tax rate to attract foreign investment has helped deliver impressive gains in per capita income (similarly in the European Union’s other main tax haven, Luxembourg) but offers no real lesson for much larger, highly dynamic open economies like the U.S.<br />Global tax rates primarily drive location decisions—where to incorporate or open a foreign headquarters—and not the initial decision to enter a new market or set of markets, in the case of the EU.<br />Ireland’s below-EU average tax rates attracted investment that historically would have gone to higher-cost but more cosmopolitan locations such as London. With Ireland’s main English-speaking rival no longer a “passport” to the EU, Ireland will soon enough be perfectly content with the proposed 15% minimum rate.<br />John Stewart<br />Summit, N.J."
