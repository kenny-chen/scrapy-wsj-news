    "body": "William A. Galston points out that government can increase productivity by improving labor-force participation (“Biden’s Slow-Growth Budget Gamble,” Politics & Ideas, June 2). He says this can be done by easing the way into the labor force for women, the formerly incarcerated, young adults not headed for college and immigrants. By and large, those measures require the government to do more. It can also improve labor-force participation by getting out of the way, and cutting back on paying people not to work.<br />S.
