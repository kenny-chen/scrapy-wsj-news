    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House voted largely along party lines, 222-190, to establish a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol after Senate Republicans blocked an earlier effort to set up a bipartisan independent commission.<br />The committee, empaneled in the House, doesn’t need approval from the Senate. It will be made up of 13 members of Congress, appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), including five she will choose after consultation with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.). Mrs. Pelosi also will pick the chairman.<br />Mrs. Pelosi is considering tapping a Republican to fill one of Democrats’ eight appointments, according to an aide. She hasn’t given any indication of who she is considering for that slot, or any of the others.<br />“It’s clear that Jan. 6 was not simply an attack on the Capitol building, it was an attack on our democracy,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a speech before the vote Wednesday. “Every member here knows that Jan. 6 was an attempt to subvert our democracy,” she said. “But many across the aisle refuse to admit the truth.”<br />House GOP leadership had recommended voting against the select committee, calling it a political exercise and pointing to ongoing law-enforcement probes. Nearly all the party’s rank and file fell into line."
