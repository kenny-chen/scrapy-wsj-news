    "body": "In “Defund the Police? No, Fund Them Better” (Declarations, May 29), Peggy Noonan misses the main reason that, as she correctly observes: “Violent crime is rising in almost every major American city, after decades of falling.”<br />Violent crime is rising because of feckless and misguided leadership and legislation in America’s large cities and states, which have introduced no-bail laws, disbanded anticrime units, made it easy for suspects to identify and retaliate against witnesses, ended broken-windows policing and quality of life law enforcement, and embraced policies designed to empty our prisons. As a result, criminals are running rampant in the streets, shooting, murdering and assaulting innocent citizens, including young children and even babies in strollers.<br />Our police and communities would benefit from additional resources and training. But that’s not why, as one young mother in Brooklyn recently said: “It’s a war zone out there.” The reason is an abysmal, abject failure of leadership. Given the blood in the streets and the fear in our hearts, I wonder how those “leaders” are able to look at themselves in the mirror.<br />Marc E. Kasowitz<br />New York"
