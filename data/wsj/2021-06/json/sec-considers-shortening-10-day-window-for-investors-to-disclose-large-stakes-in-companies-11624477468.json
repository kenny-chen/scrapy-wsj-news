    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering speeding up the deadline for investors to alert the market when they amass an ownership stake of more than 5% of a company’s stock.<br />SEC Chairman Gary Gensler on Wednesday said he has asked staff to consider updating those rules, which have been a point of contention for years between activist investors and public companies.<br />At present, investors generally have 10 days to disclose a stake in a company above the 5% threshold, a 50-year-old rule that dates to the period when market participants filed their disclosures on paper forms with the government.<br />“Those rules might’ve been appropriate for the 1970s, but I have my doubts about whether they continue to make sense given the rapidity of current markets and technologies,” he said, speaking virtually to a City & Financial Global conference in London.<br />Investors who hold a stake in a public company above the 5% threshold and plan to be active, or press for corporate change, file a form known as a 13-D. Such filings can boost a company’s shares as investors anticipate a major change sought by the large shareholder, such as board seats, a stock buyback or the sale or breakup of the company."
