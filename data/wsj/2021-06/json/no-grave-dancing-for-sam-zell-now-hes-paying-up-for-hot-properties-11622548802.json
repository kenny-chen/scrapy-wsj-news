    "body": "Sam Zell, who made a fortune buying distressed commercial properties, isn’t finding many bargains these days.<br />Instead, the storied real-estate investor is doing something he usually avoids: following the pack and spending big on something safer.<br />His most notable real estate deal during the coronavirus pandemic period came last month, when one of his companies agreed to pay about $3.4 billion for  Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corp.  Far from a hobbled company in distress, Monmouth owns 120 industrial properties in 31 states. The sector is one of the most profitable because of high demand for fulfillment centers from e-commerce companies such as  Amazon.com Inc.<br />Mr. Zell also wasn’t able to drive as hard a bargain as he had in many previous distressed deals. The all-stock deal reached in May is valued at more than $18 a share, a near-record for Monmouth stock. He could conceivably have to pay even more, since Blackwells Capital, which made an $18-a-share all-cash bid late last year, said it is weighing options including a higher offer.<br />Mr. Zell declined to comment. But the 79 year-old’s more conventional investment strategy is the latest sign that the pandemic hasn’t produced the distressed opportunities many investors expected."
