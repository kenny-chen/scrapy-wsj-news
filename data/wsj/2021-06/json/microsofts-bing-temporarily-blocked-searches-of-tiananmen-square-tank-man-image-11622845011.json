    "body": "Microsoft Corp.’s  Bing search engine blocked content in the U.S. deemed politically sensitive to China’s government on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, a move the company said was an accident that it would correct.<br />Bing users noted on social media Friday that U.S. searches on the website’s images and videos tabs for “Tank Man”—the iconic image of a man standing in front of a column of tanks after the 1989 massacre—didn’t return any hits. Searches of the same phrase on Bing’s main page, however, returned hundreds of thousands of results.<br />“This is due to an accidental human error and we are actively working to resolve this,” a Microsoft representative said in a statement Friday.<br />The statement comes as people on Friday marked the date in 1989 when Chinese troops around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square gunned down pro-democracy protesters.<br />Bing is the second-biggest search engine world-wide with a roughly 2% market share, according to May figures from Statcounter. Google dominates with a 92% global share of the market."
