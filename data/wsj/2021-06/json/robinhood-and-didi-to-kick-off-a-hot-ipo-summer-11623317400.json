    "body": "The IPO market is set to be scorching hot this summer.<br />Public filings are looming for Chinese ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and Robinhood Markets Inc., two of the most hotly anticipated initial public offerings of 2021, people familiar with the matter said. Their stocks are likely to begin trading in July. Fund managers, venture capitalists, bankers and lawyers said they are busier than they have been in decades at this time of year, which is usually quieter. Some claim business is even crazier than during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.<br />Some bankers estimated that from June through August, U.S.-listed IPOs could raise upward of $40 billion. That would eclipse the previous record of $32 billion over those three months, set last year, according to Dealogic data going back to 1995. That doesn’t include money raised by special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which were going gangbusters earlier this year but have slowed.<br />Some bankers said they are working with more than two dozen companies that have confidentially filed for IPOs and are considering starting roadshows to pitch investors in coming weeks.<br />“As prolific as issuance was last summer, we believe this year will exceed that,” said Jim Cooney, head of Americas equity-capital markets at  Bank of America Corp.  “It’s on track to be the busiest yet.”"
