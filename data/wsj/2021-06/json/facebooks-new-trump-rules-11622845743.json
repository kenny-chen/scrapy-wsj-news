    "body": "Facebook  is trying, by progressive demand, to referee American politics, and the results aren’t pretty. On Friday the social-media giant issued two new decisions—first, Donald Trump will remain banned from the platform until at least Jan. 7, 2023; and second, posts by politicians will be subject to more scrutiny by the company’s censors.<br />The Trump decision seems like another political hedge. The company initially banned the President indefinitely after his role in the Capitol riot of Jan. 6. Then it asked its liberal-leaning Oversight Board of academics, activists and others to decide whether that ban was OK. A majority said the ban was acceptable at the time, but couldn’t be “indefinite.”<br />The company has responded to this decision by the quasi-court by creating a quasi-sentencing range for politicians who act badly on Facebook, with bans ranging from one month to two years. It says Mr. Trump’s actions deserve “the highest penalty.”<br />Yet that’s a minimum sentence, not a maximum one. Facebook says Mr. Trump’s ban could be extended if “there is still a serious risk to public safety.” The company “will look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded.”<br />This comes the week after Facebook was forced, in embarrassing fashion, to reverse its censorship of commentary about the origins of the coronavirus after the “expert” consensus ruling out a lab leak collapsed. Any “expert” view about the nature of the threat of future political violence—from Trump supporters or any other source—will be political."
