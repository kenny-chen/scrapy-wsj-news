    "body": "ST PETERSBURG, Russia—Russia is to ditch the dollar from its sovereign-wealth fund, the country’s finance ministry said, as Moscow accelerates steps toward weaning its economy off the greenback amid the continuing threat of U.S. sanctions.<br />The finance ministry said the National Wealth Fund, which holds part of the country’s oil revenues, will cut the share of dollar assets it holds to zero from 35%. The $186-billion strong fund will then hold most of its assets in euros, yuan and gold, the finance ministry said.<br />The move would further strengthen the role of the Chinese currency in Russia at a time Moscow and Beijing are pursing closer ties.<br />“This is a sensible decision, it is connected, among other things, with the threats of sanctions that we received and received from the American leadership,” First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov said on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, the country’s flagship investment event.<br />Washington imposed sweeping sanctions against Russia in April over alleged interference in last year’s U.S. election, the  SolarWinds  hack of government and corporate computer networks, and other alleged transgressions."
