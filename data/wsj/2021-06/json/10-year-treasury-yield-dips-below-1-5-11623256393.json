    "body": "The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed below 1.5%, its lowest level in more than three months, dragged down by tepid economic data and high demand from investors both in the U.S. and elsewhere.<br />The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which helps set borrowing costs on everything from corporate debt to mortgages, closed at 1.489%, according to Tradeweb, its lowest settle since March 3. That was down from 1.527% Tuesday.<br />The move extends a recent drift lower that began after Friday jobs data showed a less robust labor-market recovery than expected. That eased investors’ worries that hefty hiring and wage gains would spur inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to start withdrawing easy-money policies sooner than expected.<br />Bond yields, which rise as prices fall, tend to rise when investors are expecting growth and inflation, which can spur the Fed to raise interest rates, and fall when the outlook darkens.<br />“Bond market participants looking for a market changing narrative are likely disappointed by the May jobs report,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co. interest-rate strategists in a note to clients. “It’s not that the numbers were bad, indeed they were good…but not good enough.”"
