    "body": "Before Carl Nassib could become an icon as the first active NFL player to come out as gay, he had to become an NFL player. For a long time, nobody except Nassib believed that was plausible.<br />Nassib never started a game in high school. He was a skinny walk-on at Penn State who didn’t make his first start until he was a senior. Yet he set the college football world on fire, became a valuable NFL player—and then on Monday became a historic figure in American sports.<br />Nassib, a defensive end for the Las Vegas Raiders, became the first NFL player to come out as gay while playing in the league. It was a monumental step in the country’s most popular sport during a time when male athletes at the highest levels of sports coming out as gay remains a rarity.<br />“I’ve been meaning to do this for a while now,” he said in an Instagram video, “but I finally feel comfortable enough to get it off my chest.”<br />The revelation drew widespread praise. Players, activists and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said they were proud of his decision to go public and his courage to become a first. Michael Sam, a 2014 seventh-round draft pick by the St. Louis Rams, had come out as gay but never played a regular-season game. Other players have come out after their careers were over."
