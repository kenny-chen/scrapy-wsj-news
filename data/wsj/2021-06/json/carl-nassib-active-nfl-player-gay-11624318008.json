    "body": "Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib on Monday became the first NFL player to come out as gay while still playing in the league, a significant moment in an American sport long identified with traditional ideas of masculinity.<br />“I just want to take a quick moment to say that I’m gay,” Nassib said in a one-minute video posted to his Instagram account. “I’ve been meaning to do this for a while now but I finally feel comfortable enough to get it off my chest.”<br />No openly gay player has played in a regular-season NFL game. Defensive lineman Michael Sam came out as gay before the 2014 NFL draft. He was drafted in the seventh round by the St. Louis Rams and played for them in the preseason but did not make a regular-season roster.<br />A handful of other NFL players have come out after their playing careers ended, most famously running back David Kopay in 1975.<br />The Raiders tweeted a longer statement written by Nassib and also posted on the player’s Instagram account, with the message “Proud of you, Carl” and a heart in the team’s signature black. The NFL twitter account tweeted Nassib’s video and added, “The NFL family is proud of you, Carl.”"
