    "body": "JEJU, South Korea—One Sunday afternoon in the fall of 2019, a congregation of Christians in China’s southern city of Shenzhen crammed into a rented office space to debate one of the biggest decisions of their lives: whether they should stay in China or seek exile in South Korea.<br />Chinese authorities regard the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church, an unregistered “family church” founded in 2012, as illegal. Its members say they have faced government harassment for years. Some members felt the pressure had grown too much to bear.<br />Over three hours, more than 50 debated the proposal. Some wanted to leave to ensure their children could continue their religious schooling. Some worried about finding jobs, or being forced back to China. Emotions ran high and tears were shed, participants recalled.<br />When the church reconvened for a vote the following Sunday, the result was decisive: 56 members in favor of relocating versus 17 against.<br />Under China’s leader, Xi Jinping, the Communist Party has tightened control over all aspects of society, from business to religion, and suppressed dissent with growing vigor. That has pushed more ordinary Chinese to try to leave."
