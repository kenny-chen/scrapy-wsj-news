    "body": "From a June 12 report in the Jerusalem Post:<br /><br />Hamas denounced US Rep. Ilhan Omar in a press release on Friday for equating the “Palestinian Resistance” to the “crimes of Israel and the US invasion of Afghanistan.”<br />The militant organization said that while they appreciated Mrs. Omar’s attempt at defending the Palestinian people, they “deplored the unfair combination.” . . .<br />The release refers to a conversation held by Omar with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week, a video clip of which she shared on her  Twitter  account."
