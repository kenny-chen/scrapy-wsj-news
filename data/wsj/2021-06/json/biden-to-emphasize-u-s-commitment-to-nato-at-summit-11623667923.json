    "body": "BRUSSELS—President Biden meets with leaders of NATO allies in Brussels Monday, seeking to encourage a more concerted response to Chinese security threats and to bolster an alliance jolted by broadsides from his predecessor.<br />Despite an atmosphere of renewed comity among allies, disputes simmer over how to balance new threats from China against more traditional ones from Russia and how to address threats in new domains including cyber and space. Turkey’s increasingly discordant role in the alliance also hangs over the gathering.<br />U.S. officials said Mr. Biden will emphasize his commitment to the principle of collective defense enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty that established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949, following some uncertainty about Washington’s view of the matter under former President Donald Trump.<br />“Article Five we take as a sacred obligation,” Mr. Biden said Monday during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. “I want NATO to know America is there,” he said.<br />During the meeting, NATO’s 30 member countries will take initial steps to revise the group’s Strategic Concept, which sets out the group’s goals. The Strategic Concept will be adopted next year, and is expected to touch on Russia, China, cybersecurity and climate change, according to U.S. officials."
