    "body": "SEOUL—Even inside South Korea, few people realized it remains the only country where inking tattoos is illegal without a medical license. But then the obscure law crossed paths this week with something not so obscure: the K-pop band BTS.<br />Pushing for more relaxed industry regulation, a South Korean lawmaker posted a photo of a BTS member named Jung-kook, who on a local television show had covered up his finger tattoos with bandages.<br />“Remove Band-Aids from BTS’s body,” wrote the lawmaker, Ryu Ho-jeong, on Twitter.<br />The backlash from BTS fans was swift, accusing Ms. Ryu of dragging the seven-member band into politics. Ms. Ryu, a self-proclaimed BTS fan herself, has since apologized.<br />Using a BTS member as an example is part of changing prejudices about tattoos in South Korea and attempts to create a globally competitive tattoo industry in the country, Ms. Ryu said through an aide. Highlighting the issue has generated more attention for giving South Korean tattoo artists legal status, the aide said."
