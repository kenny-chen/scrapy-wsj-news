    "body": "Luxury shoppers are splurging again.<br />Neiman Marcus Group Inc.’s sales have rebounded from last year when Covid-19 closed its stores and briefly pushed the chain into bankruptcy protection, though the results aren’t yet to pre-pandemic levels.<br />“We saw a rebound in demand starting in March and April and it has continued to accelerate,” CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck said in an interview.<br />The closely held company’s chief said he plans to invest more than $500 million over the next three years to refresh stores, speed up its supply chain and improve its digital business. The investments include an agreement to acquire Stylyze Inc., a startup that curates outfits for customers based on their past purchases and browsing history.<br />Neiman Marcus emerged from bankruptcy protection in September having eliminated $4 billion in debt that was the result of two successive leveraged buyouts. As of April, Neiman Marcus had $1.1 billion of debt, down from $5.1 billion a year ago. It had $850 million in cash and availability under its revolving credit facility, up from $132 million last year."
