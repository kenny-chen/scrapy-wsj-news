    "body": "Dan Snyder was terribly nervous.<br />A year and a half ago, the owner of the Washington Football Team stood on a dais and began one of his infrequent public statements with a viral gaffe that seemed to dovetail with a billionaire often viewed as aloof and out of touch. “First off, happy Thanksgiving everybody,” he said. Unfortunately, he was speaking in January.<br />“I didn’t read the part where it said, ‘We started this journey on Thanksgiving,’” he says now.<br />It was a small slip up on what is a perilous journey for Snyder: attempting to reform a culture and workplace environment that has produced losses on the field and far darker problems off of it.<br />Snyder, amid an ongoing investigation overseen by the NFL into allegations of misconduct inside the team, is attempting a difficult maneuver. He says he wants to establish a “gold standard” work culture at a team whose operations had been marred by inappropriate behavior, in-fighting and a team name viewed by many as racist."
