    "body": "European leaders reacted warily Thursday to a proposal from Germany and France to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, following President Biden’s summit with him last week.<br />Facing skepticism, in particular from countries that border Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel defended their proposal as necessary diplomacy.<br />“In my opinion, we as the European Union must also seek direct contact with Russia and the Russian president,” Ms. Merkel said in Parliament before flying to Brussels for a meeting with EU leaders.<br />“It is not enough for U.S. President Joe Biden to talk to the Russian president. I very much welcome that, but the EU must also create forums for dialogue,” she added.<br />Some European leaders criticized the proposal, saying it could give the impression that Russian military and destabilization campaigns against its neighbors and the West were being overlooked."
