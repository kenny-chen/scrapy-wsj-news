    "body": "Jeffrey Toobin, the former New Yorker staff writer who was fired from the magazine after he was seen masturbating while on a video call with colleagues, has returned to CNN as a legal analyst after a seven-month hiatus from the network.<br />Mr. Toobin appeared on air on the 24-hour cable news channel Thursday afternoon, with anchor Alisyn Camerota, during which he admitted his actions last year were “deeply moronic and indefensible,” but that he was a “flawed human being who makes mistakes.”<br />“I didn’t think I was on the call. I didn’t think other people could see me,” he said.<br />The New Yorker announced it was parting ways with Mr. Toobin last November after conducting a probe into what had occurred on a team Zoom call in October. He had been a staff writer for the magazine for 27 years.<br />He asked for time off from his role as legal analyst at CNN and hadn’t appeared on air since."
