    "body": "Psychedelic pop was in full flower by mid-1968 when Tommy James and the Shondells recorded “Crystal Blue Persuasion.” Included in the group’s sixth album, “Crimson & Clover,” the song was released as a single in June 1969, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard pop chart.<br />Recently, the song’s co-writer Tommy James looked back at the making of the hit. The group’s “Complete Roulette Recordings, 1966-1973” (Grapefruit) was released earlier this year. Edited from an interview.<br />Tommy James: In early 1968, I was performing with the Shondells at a small college down South. By then, we had 10 charted hits, including a No. 1 with “Hanky Panky” and two in the top five—“I Think We’re Alone Now” and “Mony Mony.”<br />During a meet-and-greet backstage after the show, a student with thick-rimmed glasses wearing a short-sleeve shirt and tie came up to me. Nervous, he handed me a sheet of notebook paper.<br />At the top was a title, “Crystal Persuasion.” The rest was a religious poem he had written, inspired by the New Testament’s Book of Revelation. He urged me to keep it. Then he took off."
