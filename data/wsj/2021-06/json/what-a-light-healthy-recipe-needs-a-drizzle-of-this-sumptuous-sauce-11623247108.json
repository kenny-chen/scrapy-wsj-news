    "body": "AS SUMMER HEATS UP, a light meal of chicken and vegetables has big appeal. Bagna cauda, the sauce of olive oil, butter, anchovies and garlic, brings a hint of richness.<br />In chef Mona Talbott’s third Slow Food Fast recipe, a quick bagna cauda makes a feast of poached chicken and seasonal vegetables. The dish recalls Ms. Talbott’s time in Italy, where she helped launch the American Academy’s Rome Sustainable Food Project.<br />Poach gently: “If the chicken needs more time, turn off the heat and let it rest in the hot water,” Ms. Talbott said. The vegetables cook in the same broth. “I call it homemade fast food,” the chef added. “The bagna cauda is a mega umami bomb.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.<br />—Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of ‘Slow Fires’ (Clarkson Potter)"
