    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS—Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is expected to be sentenced Friday afternoon for the murder of George Floyd, closing out a chapter in a case that redefined the conversation over race and policing in the U.S.<br />Mr. Chauvin, 45 years old, was convicted in April of all counts: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter in the killing of Mr. Floyd. The 46-year-old Black man died after the white officer knelt on his neck and back for more than nine minutes. Mr. Chauvin was fired from the Minneapolis police force.<br />Prosecutors are seeking a 30-year sentence, and the defense has argued for probation.<br />Activists are hoping for the maximum sought by the state. “For someone who actually committed murder, if he only gets like 15 years, that’s unacceptable,” said Trahern Crews, founder and chief organizer for Black Lives Matter Minnesota, citing higher sentences handed down over the years to Black defendants for nonviolent crimes.<br />The maximum penalty for second-degree murder in Minnesota is 40 years. State sentencing guidelines recommend 12 to 15 years for someone with no prior felony convictions, but prosecutors said they would seek a harsher sentence."
