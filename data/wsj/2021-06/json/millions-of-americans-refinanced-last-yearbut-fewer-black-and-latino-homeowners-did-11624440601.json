    "body": "Refinancings were popular in 2020, but not every household caught the wave.<br />From January to October of last year, only 6% of Black borrowers refinanced their mortgages, versus 12% of white borrowers. The findings appear in a new report by economists at the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Philadelphia and Boston.<br />Researchers matched borrower data from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA loans with data from firms that track mortgage performance, including Equifax and mortgage-data firm  Black Knight Inc.  The report found that 14% of Asian borrowers refinanced, while borrowers who identified as Latino clocked in at 9%.<br />Of an estimated $5.3 billion of savings for all households that refinanced during the 10-month period examined in the Fed report, only $198 million, or 3.7%, went to Black households. Borrowers who refinance generally pay a fee in order to lock in lower interest rates and reduce the total cost of their loan.<br />Historically low rates combined with people spending more time at home led millions to renegotiate the terms of their mortgages, resulting in eight million refinances over the course of 2020, according to data from Freddie Mac."
