    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday, putting the S&P 500 on track to close out its best week in more than two months amid renewed confidence in the global economic expansion.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 ticked up 0.1% a day after the broad stocks gauge posted a record closing high for the 30th time in 2021. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% and futures on the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 advanced 0.2%.<br />Stocks have bounced back, pushing the S&P 500 up 2.4% through Thursday, after stumbling when the Federal Reserve signaled a more hawkish stance on rising inflation last week. Fueling the gains, investors say, are data signaling a fresh acceleration in the world economy coupled with the prospect of additional government spending in the U.S. and Europe.<br />“We are still in a phase where we’re seeing the activity data still accelerate,” said Hani Redha, a fund manager at PineBridge Investments, pointing to surveys showing eurozone business activity is growing at the fastest pace in 15 years.<br />“It is natural that you’ll see very mini wobbles [in stocks] from time to time,” Mr. Redha added. “But the fundamental support—that things are improving and the numbers are getting better—is going to dominate that.”"
