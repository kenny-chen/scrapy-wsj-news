    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Proxy Coup at Exxon” (March 27): Talk about rigged elections, the current proxy system is far worse and poses a serious danger to capitalism and our economy. When a few individuals such as BlackRock’s Larry Fink, Calstrs’s Chris Ailman and similar large fund aggregators (not to mention the adviser duopoly) are allowed to vote the gazillion shares in their index and other funds, it is bizarre. They have no idea how the millions of investors in their funds might vote. Instead they substitute their own view, whether it is based on wokism, politics, marketing or whatever. Effectively they hijack the company’s governance. Individual investors in  Exxon Mobil ,  who presumably follow the company’s actions to some degree, or they wouldn’t own it, effectively have no say in the company’s governance thanks to this crazy proxy system.<br />Wayne J. Seltzer<br />Las Vegas<br /><br />Perhaps you will someday be running a sequel involving lawsuits by the investors and beneficiaries of those funds suing their boards for misusing the funds’ resources on their own personal “progressive” political agendas."
