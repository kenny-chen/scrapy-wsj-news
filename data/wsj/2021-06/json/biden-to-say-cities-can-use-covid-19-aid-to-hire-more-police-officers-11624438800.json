    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”President Biden is expected to lay out his crime-prevention strategy Wednesday amid a rise in gun violence in many cities, as Republicans seek to tie the increase in crime to calls for cuts to police departments.<br />Mr. Biden will emphasize that state and local officials in areas experiencing surges in gun violence can use $350 billion in Covid-19 funding to hire more law-enforcement personnel, even if it raises the total number beyond its pre-pandemic level, officials said.<br />They also can use that money to invest in programs that try to identify and mediate potentially violent conflicts, officials said. The administration will work with 14 cities, including Atlanta, Baltimore and Detroit, that are increasing investments in such programs, known as community violence intervention.<br />The Labor Department will use existing funding for summer workforce development programs for young people and will help connect formerly incarcerated people with jobs, officials said. The Justice Department will take additional steps to crack down on gun trafficking.<br />The president is also expected to meet Wednesday with mayors, law-enforcement officials and gun violence prevention advocates to discuss the rise in crime."
