    "body": "President Biden hailed his infrastructure deal as a job-creating economic boon, while progressive Democrats signaled they would give the president wiggle room on selling the plan, which they want paired with a wide-ranging antipoverty proposal.<br />Mr. Biden visited a transit station in La Crosse, Wis., offering a detailed rundown of the roughly $1 trillion agreement reached with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to modernize aging roads, bridges and broadband networks, eliminate lead from water pipes and build new charging stations for electric vehicles.<br />“This is a generational investment—a generational investment—to modernize our infrastructure, creating millions of good-paying jobs,” Mr. Biden said.<br />White House aides have been briefing lawmakers and their staff members in Congress about the framework, which provides $579 billion above expected federal infrastructure spending and was negotiated this month with a group of Democratic and Republican senators.<br />Advisers to the president, including White House counselor Steve Ricchetti and top legislative aides Louisa Terrell and Shuwanza Goff, met Tuesday with lawmakers from both parties, the White House said."
