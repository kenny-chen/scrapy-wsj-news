    "body": "TEL AVIV—Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rivals agreed to form a coalition government that would dislodge the country’s longest-serving leader, a major political shake-up as the nation seeks to protect a fragile truce with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.<br />If the government is sworn in within the next two weeks, Mr. Netanyahu would cede power to a coalition made up of politicians from across the ideological spectrum. Yair Lapid, who leads the centrist Yesh Atid party, and Naftali Bennett, who heads the right-wing Yamina party, will team up with six other parties, including one of Israel’s Arab parties, Raam, according to a statement from Mr. Lapid.<br />Mr. Lapid has informed Israel’s president of his government formation plan, the statement said.<br />The deal comes days after Mr. Bennett made public his plans to join Mr. Lapid in a coalition. The parliament by law has about 12 days to swear in the government after Mr. Lapid notifies the president.<br />Both leaders will take turns at leading the government, with Mr. Bennett serving first as prime minister for two years followed by Mr. Lapid, who will first serve as the foreign minister."
