    "body": "Shelby Houlihan, one of the United States’ top middle-distance runners, caused a stir this week by announcing she had received a four-year doping ban after a failed drug test that she said was caused by tainted pork in a burrito.<br />The news dropped on Monday, a few days before this Friday’s start of the U.S. Olympic track and field trials, where Houlihan was a top contender to qualify for the Tokyo Games in the 1,500 and 5,000 meters. Houlihan’s expression of innocence came against the backdrop of increasingly sensitive drug tests that some say are snagging innocent athletes along with cheaters.<br />“I have never taken any performance-enhancing substances,” Houlihan said. She added: “The most likely explanation was a burrito purchased and consumed approximately 10 hours before that drug test from an authentic Mexican food truck that serves pig offal near my house in Beaverton, Ore.” Eating pork can lead to false positives for the substance found in her sample—a steroid called nandrolone—she said she’d learned.<br />In the two days since, however, a new fact came to light that muddies her explanation: Houlihan herself isn’t sure she ate the pork burrito in question.<br />Houlihan’s lawyer, Paul J. Greene, confirmed in a Wednesday interview something first reported by the website LetsRun: that Houlihan actually ordered a carne asada burrito, not pork, the day before her drug test. They believe Houlihan was either given the wrong order or a burrito that included pork, Greene said. They don’t know for sure."
