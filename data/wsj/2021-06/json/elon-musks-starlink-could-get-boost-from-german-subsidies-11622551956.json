    "body": "BERLIN—Germany could become the first large nation to subsidize the use of consumer satellite internet services such as that offered by Elon Musk’s Starlink.<br />The German government said it was considering paying grants of around 500 euros, equivalent to $610, per household to support purchasing the hardware required to access satellite broadband and other high-speed wireless internet services. Users would have to pay for usage.<br />The program could pay out a total of €100 million, according to the government minister in charge of the project, and could launch within weeks.<br />Broadband access in Germany is limited outside large cities—and sometimes within them—due to a low penetration of fiber-optic cables compared with other European countries. In international rankings, Germany often features behind less-developed nations. According to the Speedtest Global Index, Germany ranked 35th in April, behind Panama and Poland.<br />Mr. Musk’s Starlink has emerged as an early market leader, offering high-speed internet services beamed from one of its nearly 1,500 satellites directly to users on Earth. Starlink is currently offering its service across swaths of Germany and says that it will achieve broad coverage by the end of 2021."
