    "body": "Consumers likely increased spending last month on services that they shunned earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, helping fuel the broader economic recovery.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect Friday’s Commerce Department report to show consumer spending rose 0.4% in May. They expect incomes fell 2.7% last month from April, as the boost faded from government stimulus checks sent out earlier in the year.<br />Consumer spending is supported by rising vaccination rates and ample household savings from rounds of government stimulus when the pandemic restricted businesses and activities. Customers are going out more as states and cities lift the restrictions.<br />“We believe it’s going to be a hot summer in retail,” said Jonathan Silver, chief executive of Affinity Solutions, a consumer-data firm. “People are just wanting to get out.”<br />Spending has helped propel the broader U.S. economy, which grew at a 6.4% annual rate in the first quarter. Americans appear to be shifting their spending from big-ticket items to goods and services related to going out amid business reopenings."
