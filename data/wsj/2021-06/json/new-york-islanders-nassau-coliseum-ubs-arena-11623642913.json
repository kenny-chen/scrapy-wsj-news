    "body": "ELMONT, N.Y.—There’s a certain mystique that comes with moving to Brooklyn, but the borough isn’t for everyone. The New York Islanders learned this the hard way.<br />The Islanders won four Stanley Cups in a row in the 1980s and nurtured a passionate fan base at their longtime home in Long Island at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. But the team outgrew its small, aging barn and relocated in 2015 to the  Barclays  Center—only to find the glitzy arena was deeply ill-suited for hockey.<br />The team set out to build its own $1.2 billion building, the UBS Arena, in the parking lot of the Belmont Park horse-racing track here. The venue promises to end the Islanders’ six-year odyssey to find a suitable home, though it won’t be ready to occupy until next year.<br />So for now, the team has returned to the Nassau Coliseum for what is proving to be a memorable victory lap. The Islanders have made it to the Stanley Cup semifinals for the second year in a row, showing that a rebuild under a new management team is peaking at the right time.<br />The Islanders are up one game over the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup Semifinal, having defeated the defending champions 2-1 on the road on Sunday. It’s the second time in as many years that the teams have met in hockey’s final four."
