    "body": "The number of confirmed U.S. deaths from Covid-19 surpassed 600,000 on Tuesday.<br />The milestone follows a significant slowdown in all Covid-19 metrics after a winter surge that reached every corner of the country and strained healthcare systems. Since the rollout of highly effective vaccines, deaths have plummeted, recently reaching their lowest point since March 2020.<br />Fatalities in the U.S. peaked in mid-January, when the seven-day average of reported deaths was around 3,300 a day, up from a rate of 1,100 just two months earlier, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day average, which helps smooth out states’ irregular reporting schedules for Covid-19 data, has been below 1,000 deaths since early April, and below an average of 500 deaths since the beginning of June. On Monday, it stood at 343.<br />The data reflect reports of known Covid-19 deaths from around the U.S. Epidemiologists believe the real count of pandemic-related deaths is likely higher, due both to missed Covid-19 deaths and unregistered harm inflicted by the virus.<br />Globally, more than 3.8 million deaths have been recorded, though the virus’s true mortality toll is likely far worse. More people have died from Covid-19 already this year than in all of 2020, underscoring how unevenly the pandemic spread around the globe, often hitting poorer nations later, but before they had access to vaccines."
