    "body": "For the second day in a row, a technical problem snarled  Southwest Airlines Co. ’s operations, leading to hundreds of delays and prompting the airline to cancel 500 flights.<br />Southwest said it was in the process of resuming normal operations following what it called a system issue that created disruptions throughout its network. An airline spokeswoman said multiple systems had experienced connectivity issues.<br />The Federal Aviation Administration said it had temporarily halted Southwest flights at the airline’s request Tuesday while the company resolved the problem.<br />Airlines’ IT systems have often left them vulnerable to disruptive glitches and breakdowns over the years.<br />The incident followed Monday night’s two-hour halt of Southwest flights due to what the airline described as intermittent performance issues that prevented an outside weather-data provider from transmitting weather information to the airline. Nearly 1,500 Southwest flights were delayed Monday according to FlightAware, a flight tracking site, and customers took to social media to complain about long waits on the tarmac or at airports."
