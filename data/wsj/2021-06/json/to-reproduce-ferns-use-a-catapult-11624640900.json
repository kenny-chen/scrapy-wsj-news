Read more columns here.<br />Summer has arrived, and lots of us are thinking about travel, even with current restrictions. But what do you do if you’re a firmly rooted plant, and travel isn’t an option? How do you distribute your DNA in order to reproduce?<br />There is a range of ingenious strategies to solve this problem, but my favorite belongs to the humble fern. Ferns don’t have flowers and seeds, but their offspring certainly don’t roll gently into the big wide world. At this time of year, ferns are busy growing tiny catapults.<br />Their strategy is to launch their DNA outward with so much force that it would crush most human-built technology. As the summer goes on, you’ll start to see yellow or brown dots called sori growing underneath fern leaves. These are clusters of capsules, each only one-hundredth of an inch across, that contain the spores.<br />In spite of their tiny size, each capsule is a sophisticated machine with only one job to do and one shot at getting it right. As the days get hotter, the time of launch approaches."
