Chef Mona Talbott applies her classical training to a range of deceptively simple prepared dishes that travel well. “It’s clean food,” she said. “And the beauty lies in the details.”<br />In Ms. Talbott’s second Slow Food Fast recipe, she makes turkey meatballs fresh and tempting with the addition of grated zucchini, basil, scallions and cayenne. “Turkey can be a bit dry, but the zucchini brings moisture,” she said. Ms. Talbott serves the meatballs on a mound of saffron rice with an herby, jalapeño-spiked yogurt sauce. Everything comes together quickly and can be prepared in advance, making this elegant dish easy to tote along to a picnic or potluck. At home, it’s a wholesome, satisfying meal worth bringing into the regular rotation.<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.<br />—Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of ‘Slow Fires’ (Clarkson Potter)"
