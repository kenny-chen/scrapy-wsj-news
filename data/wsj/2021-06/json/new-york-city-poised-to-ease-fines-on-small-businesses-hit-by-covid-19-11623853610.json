    "body": "The New York City Council is set to approve legislation Thursday that provides relief for small businesses, including easing code enforcement and slashing the cost of thousands of fines that mom-and-pop shops and restaurateurs were issued in the past eight years.<br />The two-bill package to aid a business sector hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic has more than enough council support to be approved at Thursday’s meeting and eventually become law, city officials said.<br />One bill, whose lead sponsor is Councilman Mark Gjonaj, a Bronx Democrat, will create a temporary amnesty program run by the city Department of Finance that offers a 75% discount on all unpaid code violations issued on or after March 7, 2020—when Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, declared a state of emergency because of the pandemic.<br />All other unpaid city code violations dating back eight years would qualify for a 25% discount. Any accrued interest or similar late fees would be waived.<br />The new 90-day program will go into effect sometime in the new fiscal year beginning in July and can be extended another 90 days. City officials are expecting to collect up to $40 million in unpaid fines through the initiative."
