    "body": "The Justice Department will move forward with its defense of former President Donald Trump in a defamation suit brought by a journalist over allegations that the former president raped her in the 1990s.<br />In a filing in New York federal court on Monday, the Justice Department signaled that it wouldn’t change position in the case, despite President Biden’s appointees taking control of the department in January.<br />The dispute was sparked after E. Jean Carroll, a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, made the allegation in an article published in New York Magazine in 2019. She wrote that in the mid-1990s Mr. Trump pushed her against a dressing-room wall at Bergdorf Goodman in New York and assaulted her.<br />After her allegations appeared in print, Mr. Trump replied: “Number one, she’s not my type. Number two, it never happened.” In response, Ms. Carroll sued the then-president in November 2019, saying he lied earlier that year when he denied raping her.<br />The Justice Department under Mr. Trump intervened last September, asking that the U.S. government be named as the plaintiff rather than Mr. Trump personally. Under existing law, the federal government can’t be sued for defamation, and the Justice Department argued that Mr. Trump was acting within the scope of his duties as president when he denied the allegation."
