    "body": "Sen. Joe Manchin is a courageous man. He has strong views and hails from a state that values independence. Recently he chose not to support the For the People Act. He also stood up for preserving the Senate filibuster. In both cases he opposed his party’s leaders.<br />Setting aside the pros or cons of his positions, the vitriol unleashed against him by his fellow Democrats is condemnable. Heaven forbid someone in American politics actually does what he thinks is right.<br />I know a thing or two about standing up to your own party. I won no friends when, as a Republican member of the House, I led opposition to President George H.W. Bush’s budget because of its sky-high deficits. My decision as governor to extend Medicaid healthcare benefits to more low-income Ohioans was lambasted by Republicans because of the move’s tie to ObamaCare. My opposition to Donald Trump sparked equal hostility.<br />What rankled me then, and frustrates me as I watch what’s happening to Mr. Manchin, is that critics always ask the wrong question. Instead of asking, “Why won’t those troublemakers just do as they’re told?” it’d be better to think of it this way: “If they’re willing to take this much heat, do they see something I don’t?”<br />Courage is valued not because it’s common or easy—just the opposite. It brings risks to prosperity, reputation and even life and limb. No one wants to be in that position. Everyone would rather be loved. Therefore, when someone is willing to risk stakes that high, shouldn’t it make us pause for a moment? Taking it a step further, when someone takes a path that potentially comes with high costs, and we only respond with criticism, are we missing something amazing unfolding right before us that we say we value—courage?"
