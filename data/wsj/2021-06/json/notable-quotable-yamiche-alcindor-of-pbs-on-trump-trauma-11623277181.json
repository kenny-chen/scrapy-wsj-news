    "body": "PBS’s Yamiche Alcindor and national security adviser Jake Sullivan at a June 7 White House press briefing:<br /><br />Alcindor: Can you talk a bit about how President Biden plans to convince, especially our European allies, that President—former President Trump was an anomaly in some ways—all the things that he did to, in some ways, traumatize those leaders; calling into question the need for NATO. What’s the plan there? And is he concerned that those scars are going to be deeper than his ability to address them in this one trip?<br />Sullivan: I think our view going into this trip is that actions speak louder than words. . . .<br />So that’s what he’s going to try to demonstrate. And he, as I said at the outset, feels he goes into this from a position of strength because of the record he’s built up over the course of the first four months."
