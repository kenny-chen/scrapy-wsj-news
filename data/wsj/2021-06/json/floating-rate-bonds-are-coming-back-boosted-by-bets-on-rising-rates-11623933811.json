    "body": "Investors are snapping up bonds with yields that rise and fall with interest rates, spurring a wave of debt offerings by blue-chip companies.<br />Nonfinancial companies including  Verizon Communications Inc.  and 7-Eleven have soldÂ more than $18 billion worth of investment-grade bonds with variable interest rates this year through June 14, according to data compiled by Dealogic. That is nearly four times the amount issued in the same period last year.<br />On Wednesday, Federal Reserve officials signaled that they expect to raise interest rates by late 2023, sooner than they had anticipated. The prospect of rising rates, even in the future, tends to make the fixed rates of traditional bonds less attractive. Accordingly, more investors are moving to floating-rate bonds, so that their portfolios will be at least partly cushioned against the impact of future rate increases.<br />When including sales from U.S. banks, about $134 billion of floating-rate corporate bonds have been issued as of May, according to  Bank of America Corp.  That nearly matches the average annual issuance of $135 billion since 2008.<br />Expectations for higher interest rates have also stoked investor demand for other assets with floating yields, such as corporate loans with junk credit ratings."
