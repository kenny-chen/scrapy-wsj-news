    "body": "Selling in  ether and dogecoin accelerated Tuesday, with concerns about heightened government intervention adding to recent pressure on cryptocurrencies.<br />Bitcoin slid about 10% before recovering a bit to trade near $32,400, according to CoinDesk, down around 50% from its all-time high and near spring lows. Ether slipped more than 12% to $2,327.50 and joke cryptocurrency dogecoin—a favorite of individual investors—tumbled more than 13% to trade near 30 U.S. cents.<br />Bitcoin traders are “falling out of love once again,” said AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam, “and it seems like the bulls are losing more ground.”<br />The recent skid marks a reversal after bitcoin rallied to more than $64,000 in April—doubling in price in less than four months and attracting a new wave of retail and institutional investors.<br />Billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has disclosed bitcoin holdings. Elon Musk’s  Tesla Inc.  bought $1.5 billion worth.  Coinbase Global Inc.,  the largest U.S. exchange, saw its user base rise to about 56 million in the first quarter from 34 million a year earlier."
