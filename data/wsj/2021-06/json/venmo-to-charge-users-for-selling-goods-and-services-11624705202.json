    "body": "Venmo, the payments app owned by  PayPal Holdings Inc.,  will soon allow users to sell products and services on their personal accounts, for a fee.<br />Under the app’s previous rules, users were prohibited from receiving money for business transactions through personal Venmo profiles. Users suspected of violating the policy could have their accounts suspended.<br />The new policy, disclosed in a letter to users about terms-of-service updates, will take effect on July 20.<br />A Venmo spokeswoman said the latest changes mean users who don’t want to create a business profile will be allowed to accept money for goods and services without worrying about running afoul of the rules. They will be charged the same 1.9% plus 10-cent fee applied to customers using business profiles.<br />The change is the latest attempt by PayPal to profit from Venmo’s massive user base. The company rolled out the first Venmo-branded physical credit card last year, looking to attract customers by touting the QR code on the front of the card, and a flexible cash-back rewards program."
