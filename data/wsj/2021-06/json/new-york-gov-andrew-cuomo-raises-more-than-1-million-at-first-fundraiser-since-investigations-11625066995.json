    "body": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo drew more than 150 guests to a $10,000-a-head campaign fundraiser Tuesday night, his first since the launch of state and federal investigations into sexual-harassment accusations against him and into his administration’s handling of the coronavirus at nursing homes.<br />Democratic Party officials, labor leaders, lobbyists and real-estate developers gathered at a space in Manhattan’s Rockefeller Center, where Mr. Cuomo didn’t mention the probes during his remarks but warned of the rising power of socialist Democrats, attendees said.<br />The soiree was expected to raise more than $1 million for Mr. Cuomo’s re-election campaign, a haul that will be reflected in a campaign disclosure report due in July, two people familiar with the event said. In January, Mr. Cuomo reported $16.8 million in his campaign war chest.<br />Some attendees described the fundraiser as a show of political force as the Democratic governor prepares to campaign for a possible run at a fourth term in 2022.<br />Spokespeople for Mr. Cuomo declined to comment and the governor didn’t answer questions from a reporter as he entered the event through a loading dock. The governor said last year that he planned to seek a fourth term."
