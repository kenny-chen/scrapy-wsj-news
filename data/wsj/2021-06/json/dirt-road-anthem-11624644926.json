    "body": "After announcing his agreement with 10 senators to compromise on his spending plans on Thursday, President Joe Biden then announced that he will block his new deal unless he also gets the spending that he just negotiated away. Regardless of how this bizarre drama ends, taxpayers should steel themselves for the likely outcome: Washington is going to spend a lot of money building very little infrastructure.<br />Regarding the Biden back flip, A Journal editorial notes:<br />As for his first Thursday announcement, according to an official White House transcript, here’s how President Biden began his remarks to reporters following his meeting with the bipartisan group of senators:<br />This column won’t try to precisely interpret that last paragraph. Clearly the overall thrust of his remarks was that he and the senators had reached an agreement in which nobody got everything they wanted. But within hours he was back demanding everything he wanted.<br />More bad news is that even if the president sticks to the deal he struck with the senators, it won’t be kind to taxpayers. Even without most of the phony Biden redistribution programs labeled as “infrastructure,” the plan still isn’t going to build that much infrastructure."
