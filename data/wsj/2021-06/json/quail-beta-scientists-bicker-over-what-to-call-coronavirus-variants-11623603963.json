    "body": "An idea reached the World Health Organization earlier this year: How about naming new variants of the coronavirus after sing-songy North American birds?<br />Repurposing the robin or quail as catchy labels for ungainly mutants would be less confusing for the public, an epidemiologist based in Switzerland had mused. That would appease politicians in member states like South Africa and India who were unhappy with the way ordinary people named new virus strains after the country where they were first discovered: “the South African variant,” “the Indian variant.”<br />Feathers were ruffled.<br />“It is almost inevitable that some will mistakenly think the birds carry or are responsible for Covid, putting robins and pelicans at risk the world over,” one commenter on a research paper protested. “If the ‘Robin’ variant takes off, you will be impacting my daughter and every other person named Robin,” complained another.<br />It’s hard to find a good name for a bad virus. In December, the WHO began brainstorming an easy-to-remember system for naming coronavirus variants that would be acceptable to 190-some member states, and the vast community of scientists who follow, and often nitpick, the agency’s recommendations."
