    "body": "CALI, Colombia—For the past two decades, this Colombian city has worked hard to counter its image as a hotbed of drug gangs and thugs. The city government launched social programs and other initiatives that cut crime here by more than half and led to an economic renaissance.<br />But the pandemic, and now social protests as a result of hardship caused by the pandemic, have upended all that, plunging Cali into chaos amid six weeks of violent antigovernment demonstrations. Making matters worse, young men from Cali’s vast network of drug-dealing gangs are taking advantage of the anarchy to settle turf wars, helping send the murder rate skyrocketing.<br />Homicides in Cali nearly doubled to 172 in May from a year earlier.<br />“We’ve never lived a moment of such magnitude,” said Mayor Jorge Iván Ospina. “It’s all so dramatic. The breakdown in public order is permitting criminal activity to strengthen.”<br />The tensions in Cali, where poverty measured by income grew 67% during 2020, is a warning to cities around Latin America and the developing world where the health crisis took priority over spending on social programs and antiviolence initiatives. Gangs here are now surging."
