    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Prairie Chicken Fillet” (June 23): Significant portions of the 21 million acres in the Biden administration’s proposed land grab have potential for other mineral deposits aside from oil and gas, including rare earths and copper, critical to development of alternative energy sources. President Biden has promised to fast-track development of these critical metals. Environmental groups reflexively fight development of any new mine anywhere, and Mr. Biden’s prairie-chicken gift will further enable them to block production of metals vital to the new energy sources for which they cry—a situation that defies common sense.<br />M.A. Kaufman<br />Spokane Valley, Wash."
