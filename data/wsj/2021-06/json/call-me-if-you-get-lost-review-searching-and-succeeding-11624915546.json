    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Early on, media-savvy rapper, producer and mogul Tyler, the Creator (born Tyler Okonma and raised in Los Angeles County), like so many musical artists before him, knew that controversy was a great way to get attention when no one knows who you are. Between 2007 and 2010, his mostly teenage collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, which included eventual stars like rapper Earl Sweatshirt and singer Frank Ocean, issued a string of influential homemade mixtapes. Much of the music coming from the camp featured shocking lyrics filled with homophobia, misogyny and violent imagery—the grisly B-movie stories of hip-hop’s horrorcore subgenre were a point of comparison—only some of which seemed played for laughs. Tyler’s full-length debut LP, 2011’s “Goblin,” picked up where the early work left off in terms of its grim subject matter.<br />Had he stuck with the shock tactics—Eminem was a major influence—Tyler, now 30 years old, probably would have remained a cult artist. But with each new release he has let more of his personality show, and his musical talent developed in parallel. His 2017 record, “Flower Boy,” was newly vulnerable and easily his best work to that point, and with 2019’s “Igor” he snagged both a Grammy and had his first No. 1 LP on the Billboard 200."
