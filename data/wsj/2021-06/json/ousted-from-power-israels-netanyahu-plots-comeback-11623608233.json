    "body": "TEL AVIV—Outmaneuvered by rival politicians after 12 years in power, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is already plotting a comeback, intending to challenge the new government on matters that could deeply divide the cross-party coalition.<br />Mr. Netanyahu, who now is expected to lead the opposition, plans to press the new governing coalition, which includes eight parties ranging from an Arab group to conservative forces, on sensitive policy issues such as settlement construction and empowering the country’s Arabs.<br />He is hoping the coalition will buckle under pressure, according to people familiar with his plans, which would send the country into a fifth election since 2019 and give Israel’s longest-serving leader another shot at power.<br />“I will wage a daily battle against this bad, dangerous left-wing government to topple it,” Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday in parliament, ahead of the confidence vote for the new coalition. “With God’s help it will be much sooner than you think.”<br />In addition to pressing domestic issues that could be divisive, Mr. Netanyahu said he is also looking to draw contrast between himself and the new government on the U.S. effort to re-enter the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Israel opposes."
