    "body": "Randall Kennedy of Harvard Law School writing for the American Prospect, June 22:<br /><br />I predict that Justice Stephen Breyer will submit to President Joseph Biden by the end of this Supreme Court term a letter of resignation to become effective upon the confirmation of a successor.<br />This will happen because Breyer is a wise person animated by liberal commitments who understands the precarity of the political situation surrounding the Court and the need to install soon a jurist who would be a suitable successor. At the moment, the Democratic Party controls the Senate, but only by the thinnest of margins. It faces a Republican Party that could retake control with the slightest diminution of Democratic voting strength. This Republican Party has shown itself willing, if empowered, to stymie a nomination—any nomination—by a Democratic president until such time that a Republican can recapture the White House. . . . [Justice Breyer] saw up close the debacle of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s denouement. Surely he wants to guarantee that his legacy will be free of the awful stain that taints Ginsburg’s reputation."
