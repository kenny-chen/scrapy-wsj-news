    "body": "Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will be interviewed Monday at 11:05 a.m. ET at The Wall Street Journal’s CFO Network event.<br />Mr. Gensler is expected to discuss his policy-making priorities, including the development of new corporate disclosure standards related to climate change. The Biden administration has urged the SEC and other financial regulators to require more standardized reporting by public companies and the financial sector on climate-change risks and impacts.<br />Mr. Gensler has also signaled the SEC is drafting new rules or guidelines for special-purpose acquisition companies, a deal-making structure that flourished during the past year as an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. Mr. Gensler has questioned whether SPACs, which raised more than $100 billion this year, are good for small investors, who may not understand their complex structure and conflicts of interest.<br />Mr. Gensler, a Democratic appointee, took over control of the SEC in April. He was chairman of the SEC’s sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, during the Obama administration. At the CFTC, he implemented rules intended to reduce risk and increase transparency in the swaps market, after unregulated trading helped inflame the 2008 financial crisis. The CFTC under Mr. Gensler pushed most standardized swaps trades onto exchanges and required them to be guaranteed by clearinghouses.<br />Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com"
