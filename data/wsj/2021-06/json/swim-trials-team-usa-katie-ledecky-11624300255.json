    "body": "OMAHA, Neb.—When the pandemic shut pools and forced swimmers out of the water for weeks last spring, no one knew how the disruption would shape Team USA’s swimming fortunes at the Tokyo Olympics.<br />Eight days of unpredictable, upset-filled racing at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials for Swimming in Omaha, Neb., have provided the answer. The U.S. swimming team is very young, very fast and nothing like what anyone expected a year ago.<br />The field of 24 men and 26 women headed to Tokyo is remarkable for its lack of Olympic experience. The women’s team has more teenagers (10) than Olympic veterans (six); the men have seven returning Olympians, but none have experience predating 2016.<br />It’s a telling look at the state of American swimming in the post-Michael Phelps era. It’s no less fast—five American records were set at the CHI Health Center Arena over the past week—but it is younger and more unheralded. The burden to win medals will fall to freestyle star Katie Ledecky, world-record holding backstroker Ryan Murphy and Caeleb Dressel, one of the fastest men in the world.<br />“The team is so young I’m going to have to learn everyone’s name,” said Dressel. He didn’t have that problem on his first Team USA in 2016, when the roster included many of his childhood heroes. “I’m so bad with names so I’m kind of nervous about that.”"
