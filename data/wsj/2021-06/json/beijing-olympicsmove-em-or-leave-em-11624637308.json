    "body": "Expecting any push back from the International Olympic Committee on the genocide of the Uyghurs is wishful thinking by Rayhan Asat (“If Uyghur Lives Matter, the Olympics Should Move,” op-ed, June 17). The only significant option is for the U.S. to officially withdraw. Recall that the U.S. and many other countries, including China, withdrew from the 1980 summer games in Russia. If U.S. social-justice activists can admonish our country, then it should be a far greater imperative to call out the Chinese Communist Party for its atrocities. If former President Jimmy Carter was able to effectuate that withdrawal with majority support, then, in the hypermoral climate of today, surely President Biden should be able to accomplish the same.<br />Mike Finnegan<br />Media, Pa.<br /><br />In October 2019, I wrote to IOC President Thomas Bach about the atrocities occurring at the hands of China’s communist government. In my letter, I made a direct request: Move the 2022 Olympic Games to a nation that values human rights. Since then, I have repeatedly called on the IOC, Olympic sponsors, NBCUniversal, President Biden and his fellow world leaders, and many others to join our calls to relocate the games. Most have remained silent, but I won’t."
