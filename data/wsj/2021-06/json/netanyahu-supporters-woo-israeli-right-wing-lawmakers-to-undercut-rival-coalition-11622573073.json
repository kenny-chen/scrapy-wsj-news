    "body": "TEL AVIV—As his rivals team up to drive him from power, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is making a last-ditch attempt to convince some right-wing lawmakers to abandon the prospective coalition.<br />Mr. Netanyahu’s supporters, including Likud lawmakers close to him, have made calls and sent text messages in recent days to many of these lawmakers, according to people familiar with the matter. Three right-wing parties—New Hope, Yamina and Yisrael Beiteinu—have said they would join the new coalition.<br />It is “an absolute all-out onslaught of pressure,” one of the people said.<br />Sharpen Haskel, one of several lawmakers who left Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party last year to join the New Hope party, said Tuesday she had “many approaches from Likud members and supporters” to defect. But she said she didn’t intend to.<br />A Likud spokesman said “we are making every effort” to prevent the establishment of the rival coalition’s government."
