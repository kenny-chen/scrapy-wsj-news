    "body": "The New York City Council is considering a legislative package aimed at significantly regulating the food-delivery app industry, including permanently limiting fees that operators like Grubhub and Uber Eats can charge restaurants.<br />In a bid to help the city’s struggling restaurant industry survive the Covid-19 pandemic, the council last year passed legislation temporarily prohibiting third-party food-delivery services from charging eateries more than 15% per delivery order and more than 5% for marketing and other nondelivery fees.<br />However, the combined 20% cap is set to expire Aug. 17. It only covers the first 90 days after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo allowed indoor dining to reopen May 19 at full capacity statewide.<br />Some small restaurant operators say the app fees typically can run them a combined 30% or more of what they take in on every order.<br />A new bill sponsored by Councilman Francisco Moya, a Queens Democrat, would make the cap permanent. Violators would face up to $1,000 a day in fines per restaurant, the same penalty covered under the temporary law."
