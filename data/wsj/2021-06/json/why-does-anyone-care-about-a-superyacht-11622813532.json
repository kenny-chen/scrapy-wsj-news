    "body": "Spend any time consuming news media, and you’ll develop a keen sense for what sort of stories reliably move the needle with readers: celebrity couplings, celebrity marriages, celebrity divorces, hideous real estate, crooked pols, lost fortunes, overnight millionaires, inexpensive beach vacations, feuding royals and, of course, possible UFOs.<br />There’s also a thriving industry of upbeat, animal-based media, from Very Large Pets to Bears in Pools, and my personal favorite, Unlikely Animal Buddies (dog palling around with a tortoise, tortoise palling around with a squirrel, squirrel palling around with a crooked pol aboard a possible UFO.)<br />I believe we can safely add another topic to the list of attention-grabbing gold:<br />Superyachts.<br />Superyacht coverage falls attractively into the media Venn diagram between “This is Outrageous Consumerism” and “OK Fine I Need to Look at These Crazy Pictures.” I want to ignore such pieces, but I can’t resist. Put me within 10 nautical miles of a superyacht story, and I’m paddling over in a kayak to gawk at the absurdist spending, the daffy, futuristic designs (most superyachts look like pirate-themed Atlantic City casinos) and, of course, the luxuriant details, from restaurant-grade kitchens to screening rooms to velvety libraries of never-cracked books."
