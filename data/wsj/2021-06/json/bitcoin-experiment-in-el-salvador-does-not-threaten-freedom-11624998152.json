    "body": "Steve Hanke and Manuel Hinds’s op-ed “El Salvador’s Big Bitcoin Mistake” (June 23) histrionically compares the country’s Bitcoin Law to “forced tender” currency laws in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. But the Bitcoin Law does not prohibit merchants from accepting payments in dollars, euros, Honduran lempiras or any other currency. The U.S. dollar also remains legal tender under the law, giving Salvadorans the rare opportunity to pay their taxes and debts in one of two currencies, neither of which is controlled by the Salvadoran government—hardly the stuff of totalitarian regimes.<br />It’s true that Article 7 of the Bitcoin Law requires merchants to accept bitcoin. But merchants are expressly not required to hold the digital currency; the Salvadoran government has created a trust that will immediately exchange unwanted bitcoin into dollars. Taken together, these are sensible steps that will help the 70% of Salvadorans without bank accounts join the 21st-century financial system.<br />Avik Roy<br />President, The Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity<br />Austin, Texas"
