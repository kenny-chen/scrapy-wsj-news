    "body": "One of  Credit Suisse Group AG’s  biggest and longest-term shareholders, the Qatar Investment Authority, trimmed its stake in the bank, a blow to the beleaguered Swiss lender.<br />QIA, a sovereign-wealth fund of the gas-rich Gulf state, cut its stake to 4.8% from 5.2% on Wednesday, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Credit Suisse is under pressure to revamp following twin scandals from the failures of Archegos Capital Management and Greensill Capital.<br />QIA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment.<br />The Qatar fund first took a large stake in Credit Suisse in 2008 and helped shore up its capital as the financial crisis hit. It reported a stake of just under 10% in Credit Suisse shares and derivatives that year and reduced the stake since then.<br />Credit Suisse lost around $5.5 billion this spring from exiting large, concentrated stock positions of Archegos Capital, a New York-based family office that came undone when some of the stocks fell and it couldn’t meet margin calls. Other banks including  Morgan Stanley  and  UBS Group AG  also lost money."
