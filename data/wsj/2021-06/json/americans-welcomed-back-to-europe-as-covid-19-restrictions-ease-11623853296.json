    "body": "The European Union agreed to open the door to American tourists for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, giving a boost to the continent’s crucial tourism industry and Americans’ summer travel options.<br />The EU Wednesday added the U.S. to the bloc’s “white list” of countries from where tourists can enter, according to diplomats. After the measure is rubber stamped at an EU meeting in Brussels on Friday, Americans will be free to visit the 27-nation bloc for the first time since March of last year. The EU last month said it intended to open up to Americans, but hadn’t set a date for when it would become official.<br />Some EU countries heavily dependent on tourism, including Italy and Greece, have already opened to Americans. Mediterranean countries would struggle to absorb another summer with few foreign tourists after last year’s costly lockdowns. Italy, Greece and France all suffered gross domestic product declines of more than 8% in 2020. Spain’s economy shrank by 11%.<br />With the U.S. now on the white list, most restrictions will be removed across the region, though countries can add their own requirements for entry. Most countries are expected to require tourists show either proof of vaccination, a negative Covid-19 test or a document attesting they have recovered from the disease.<br />Japan, Australia, Israel and several other countries are already on the EU white list. Countries added this week with the U.S. include Serbia and Lebanon."
