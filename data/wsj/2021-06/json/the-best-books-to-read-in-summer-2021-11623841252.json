    "body": "Book lovers shaking last year’s sand from their beach bags are eager to restock with the latest page-turners. To help them, The Wall Street Journal asked a dozen prominent readers, writers and book-world insiders what works of fiction excite them this season. Here are their suggestions, some published in the spring, many coming this summer:<br /><br /><br />Recommended by Brit Bennett, author of last year’s critical and commercial hit, “The Vanishing Half”<br />“This is the book everyone will be talking about this summer,” Ms. Bennett says. Already a bestseller, the book is a darkly comic and thought-provoking take on what Ms. Bennett calls “the oppressive whiteness of publishing.” Author Zakiya Dalila Harris, 28, worked in the New York publishing world for more than two years. The novel, her first, sold for $1 million."
