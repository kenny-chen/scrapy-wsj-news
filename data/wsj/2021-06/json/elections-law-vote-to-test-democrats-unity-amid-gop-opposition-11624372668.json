    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Democrats united behind making changes to election laws but were set to hit a roadblock in a procedural vote later Tuesday, after weeks of intraparty wrangling and fruitless calls from progressives to advance the legislation without Republican support.<br />With no GOP backing in the evenly divided Senate, the bill was expected to fall short of the 60 senators needed to open debate, blocking the measure.<br />A central element of Democratic uncertainty was resolved just hours ahead of the vote, when holdout Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) said he would support the motion to proceed. His shift came after Democratic leaders agreed to make changes to the initial legislation, called S-1, which he opposed as too sweeping.<br />Election legislation has become a priority for Democratic lawmakers, who say it would preserve and expand voter access as many GOP-led states pursue tighter laws and allies of former President Donald Trump continue to challenge the 2020 election results. Republicans have called the Democrats’ push a power grab that would undercut election security.<br />Signaling the importance of the effort to the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris planned to preside over the Senate as the vote was tallied. The White House said President Biden and Democrats would continue to push the matter, without giving details."
