    "body": "Foster Friess took the fortune built through his stock-picking firm and turned it into a force in Republican politics.<br />When former senator Rick Santorum ran for the Republican presidential nomination for the 2012 election on a shoestring budget, the multimillionaire stepped in as a primary financier. Mr. Friess’s money supercharged Mr. Santorum’s campaign and propelled the presidential hopeful to a surprise win in the Iowa caucus.<br />Mr. Friess became one of the most sought-after GOP mega donors and a supporter of Donald Trump’s presidential run. He channeled his money to push for conservative fiscal policies, donating more than $500 million to charitable and political causes over his lifetime, according to Foster’s Outriders, his civic nonprofit foundation.<br />He died on May 27 at age 81. The cause was myelodysplastic syndrome, a disorder of the blood cells and bone marrow, a family spokesman said.<br />He was one of the most visible faces of an era where wealthy individuals and businesses started to exert more influence over American politics. The influence was fueled by looser campaign-finance rules and the rise of Super PACs, or political action committees that can receive unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations and other groups."
