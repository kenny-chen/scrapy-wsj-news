    "body": "A St. Louis couple who pointed guns at social-justice demonstratorslast year pleaded guilty Thursday to misdemeanor charges and agreed to give up the weapons they used during the confrontation.<br />Patricia McCloskey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment and was fined $2,000. Her husband, Mark McCloskey, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and was fined $750.<br />When several hundred demonstrators marched past their home in June 2020, the couple waved weapons at them. They said the protesters were trespassing and that they feared for their safety.<br />The McCloskeys, both of them lawyers in their 60s, wore blue blazers and spoke calmly in answering questions from Judge David Mason during Thursday’s hearing. Judge Mason asked Mr. McCloskey if he acknowledged that his actions put people at risk of personal injury. He replied, “I sure did, your honor.”<br />Mr. McCloskey, who announced in May that he was running for a U.S. Senate seat in Missouri, was unapologetic after the hearing."
