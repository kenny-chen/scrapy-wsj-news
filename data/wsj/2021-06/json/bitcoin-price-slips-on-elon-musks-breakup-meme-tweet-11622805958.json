    "body": "Bitcoin, dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies skidded Friday, extending their monthlong rout, following another cryptic tweet from Elon Musk.<br />Bitcoin was down almost 5% from its price at 9 p.m. ET Thursday. That was minutes before the Tesla Inc. chief executive tweeted breakup memes with “#bitcoin” and a broken-heart emoji. Bitcoin’s price slid to $36,827.50, a far cry from the record $64,802 it traded at in mid-April.<br />Prices of other cryptocurrencies also took a beating: Ether dropped about 6% from its 5 p.m. Thursday level to $2,637.49. Dogecoin, another favorite of Mr. Musk’s, declined more than 9% to about 36 cents.<br />Two hours after his initial tweet, Mr. Musk published an “I miss you” meme. The two posts elicited thousands of comments, including images of a shuddering man, as well as requests to “leave us alone” and “stop manipulating.” They also prompted some  Twitter  users to block Mr. Musk, but that hasn’t made a dent in his more than 55 million followers.<br />Mr. Musk and representatives of Tesla weren’t immediately reachable for comment ahead of U.S. business hours."
