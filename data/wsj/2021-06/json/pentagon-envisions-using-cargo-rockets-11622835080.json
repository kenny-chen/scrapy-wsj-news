    "body": "The Pentagon has revived plans to use commercial rockets such as those being developed by SpaceX to deliver supplies to military hot spots.<br />The U.S. Air Force in partnership with the new Space Force said Friday that it wants to leverage work that companies are doing on space delivery to allow for the transport of up to 100 tons of military cargo anywhere in the world within an hour. That’s roughly the carrying capacity of a C-17 military transport jet.<br />Pentagon officials said recent technological advances are removing obstacles to space delivery, such as the risk of rockets heading back to earth being mistaken for nuclear missiles. Reusable rockets are bringing down the cost of space launches, and the reliability required for military use is also improving. Elon Musk’s SpaceX on Thursday notched its 101st successful mission in a row.<br />“It looks like technology may have caught up with a good idea,” said Greg Spanjers, program manager for the new Air Force Rocket Cargo initiative.<br />SpaceX and other private firms have outlined plans to provide cargo services via their rockets, launching loads into space that would be landed or parachuted to their final destination."
