    "body": "ESG investing has come a long way in the past few years.<br />Once a niche investment sector, strategies that screen companies and other assets based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are attracting more money than ever.<br />There are various definitions of—and approaches to—so-called sustainable investing. Some strategies seek to avoid investments in industries deemed harmful to society such as tobacco, while others aim to further environmental or social causes like climate change or workplace diversity. Regardless of the approach, interest in the category as a whole is growing dramatically.<br />At the end of 2019, about $17.1 trillion—roughly one-third of all assets under professional management in the U.S.—was being managed using some type of sustainable-investment strategy or by institutions that filed shareholder resolutions on ESG issues, according to the most recent data from the US SIF Foundation, a sustainable-investing trade group. That was a 42% increase from two years earlier, the group said.<br />In the first quarter of this year, meanwhile, a net $21.5 billion flowed into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that use ESG screens or some other type of sustainable-investing approach, a record amount and almost double the net inflows in the year-earlier quarter, according to a report from Morningstar Inc."
