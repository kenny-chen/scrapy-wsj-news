    "body": "LONDON—As the European Championship’s infamous Group of Death battled for survival last Wednesday, it appeared that any of four teams could be England’s opponent in the tournament’s knockout round. During a frantic hour of play, the Three Lions were variously set to face France, Portugal and even Hungary.<br />When the dust settled, however, the inevitable had happened: their opponent would be Germany. For England, it was always going to be Germany.<br />No single opponent has caused more Sturm und Drang in the minds of English fans than the country that also gifted them the modern process for brewing beer and the aspirin to cope with its excesses. And on Tuesday, they will meet in a major tournament on British soil for only the second time since England defeated what was then West Germany in the final of the 1966 World Cup at Wembley Stadium.<br />Ever since then, England fans have wrapped up their soccer history in an unhealthy dose of jingoism that turns matches into opportunities to dredge up World War II. It reached a peak during Euro 1996, held here, when the Daily Mirror tabloid famously printed the headline “Achtung! Surrender!” before an England-Germany semifinal. Germany did not follow the instruction and went on to win the whole tournament.<br />Yet while the country endlessly obsesses over its history with Germany, England’s players do not."
