    "body": "When Jateria Pittman took her first international trip for a study-abroad program seven years ago, she was on a path to a corporate career in the mortgage industry.<br />Then a marketing major in her senior year at Appalachian State University, Ms. Pittman, the first person in her family to attend college, qualified for a six-month study-abroad program in Johannesburg.<br />Initially, she wasn’t sure she should go, telling herself to “just sit down and be grateful” for making it into college. But ultimately, Ms. Pittman decided to go to Johannesburg, rationalizing that it would be an important part of her college education. The experience was life-changing.<br />After graduating in 2015, Ms. Pittman quickly landed a job as a mortgage processor at a company in Charlotte, N.C. But she quit after a year, finding the job a letdown after her transformative time in South Africa.<br />“The trip just really opened my eyes up to a different quality of life,” said Ms. Pittman, who is 28, lives in Atlanta, and is the first in her family to have a passport. After the freedom of traveling, the confines of her first desk job made her second guess her career choice. “This is what I’ve been working so hard for, for so long, to be sitting here in an office and having to ask ‘can I take time off to go to the doctor?’” she says. “This isn’t the dream that I wanted to live at all.”"
