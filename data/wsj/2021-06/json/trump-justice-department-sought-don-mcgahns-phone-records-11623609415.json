    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department subpoenaed tech giant  Apple Inc.  for information about an account belonging to Donald Trump’s former White House counsel Don McGahn in February 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />The disclosure came amid political fallout from revelations that the Trump administration also secretly sought the records of journalists and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, at a time when officials were trying to locate the source of leaks of sensitive information to the media.<br />The former president in particular had complained about a series of leaks related to contacts between Russia and figures in his 2016 election campaign, and special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into them.<br />It isn’t clear what FBI agents were investigating when they sought information about Mr. McGahn, who served as the top legal adviser to Mr. Trump and was also a witness in Mr. Mueller’s probe.<br />Apple didn’t tell Mr. McGahn what it provided to the government, and the Justice Department barred the company from telling him about the subpoena at the time, the person familiar with the matter said. Apple informed Mr. McGahn in May, a move first reported by the New York Times."
