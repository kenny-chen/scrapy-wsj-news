    "body": "This is still a market that rewards expensive moonshots over incremental technology improvements.<br />The latest electric-vehicle business to announce plans to go public via a special-purpose acquisition company is Solid Power, a Colorado-based developer of next-generation “solid-state” battery technology. On Tuesday,  Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation III  said it would buy Solid Power for $1.2 billion. Including cash from the SPAC and the fundraising held alongside the deal, the combined companies would have a market value of roughly $1.9 billion at the current share price.<br />That is a lot less than the $12.8 billion market value of the other U.S.-listed solid-state battery company. California-based  QuantumScape ,  which merged with a SPAC last year, became an investor darling after reporting some promising test results in December. Around Christmas, its market capitalization exceeded that of  Ford Motor .  The stock has since plummeted as investors have cooled on EV-related startups more generally, but the company is still more highly valued than most pre-revenue peers in the sector.<br />The lithium-ion batteries in today’s smartphones and Teslas contain a potentially flammable liquid electrolyte to ferry lithium ions between the cathode and anode in the charging and discharging process. Solid-state batteries promise to replace the liquid with a solid. While that solves some problems, the industry is particularly excited about the “lithium-metal” anodes that solid electrolytes might enable. These could bring massive theoretical cost savings and make long-range EVs much cheaper than traditional cars.<br />Coming up with a viable material for the solid electrolyte has proved an enormous challenge, though. QuantumScape thinks it has hit on a ceramic that works with a lithium-metal anode, and the test results that it has released are promising, albeit limited. Solid Power is pursuing another electrolyte material called a sulfide, and may be further down the testing route than QuantumScape. But the results it published with lithium-metal anodes were disappointing, so it is working with a more conventional silicon anode as a first step."
