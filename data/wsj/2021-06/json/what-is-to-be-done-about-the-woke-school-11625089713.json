    "body": "What makes Prof. John Rose’s account of his “liberated” class at Duke so interesting is that civil discourse is such an exception in higher education today (“How I Liberated My College Classroom,” op-ed, June 25). That is reflected in multiple surveys on self-censorship and bias on campus and by Mr. Rose’s own course survey showing 68% of his Duke students self-censor.<br />I applaud the professor for his refreshing course offerings, but I disagree with his call for conservatives to continue supporting higher education. Those wishing to promote true liberal principles, including the values of Western civilization, free speech, the American founding and civility, should look to the network of outstanding independent organizations to bring these values to college students from outside the walls of academe. We have passed the point where we can expect the woke university to reform itself.<br />Roger R. Ream<br />The Fund for American Studies<br />Washington"
