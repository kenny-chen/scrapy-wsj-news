    "body": "Worker filings for jobless benefits last week are predicted to have declined, resuming a mostly downward trend since spring that has been supported by a strengthening economic recovery.<br />Economists estimate the Labor Department will report Thursday that initial unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, moved lower last week to 380,000 from 412,000 the prior week, when claims rose by 37,000.<br />That uptick was a departure from the recent trend, as claims had fallen in each of the previous six weeks. Claims are down sharply from the depths of the Covid-19-induced downturn during 2020, and are hovering at levels half of what they were in January this year. Weekly claims totals are down more than 40% from the 742,000 total posted the week ended April 3.<br />While initial claims remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, their steady decline, along with a pickup in hiring, a declining unemployment rate and optimistic consumer sentiment, points to gains for the U.S. labor market.<br />“The overall trend is in the right direction,” said Jordan van Rijn, senior economist at the Credit Union National Association. “Right now, there’s a lot of demand for labor out there and it’s the workers that are a little more in the driver’s seat,” he added."
