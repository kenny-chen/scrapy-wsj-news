    "body": "Stocks closed out the first half of the year with double-digit percentage gains, powered by an economic recovery that many investors believe is still gathering pace.<br />The S&P 500 is up 14% this year, closing June at a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 13%. This quarter will mark both indexes’ fifth consecutive quarter of gains, their longest such streak since a nine-quarter stretch that lasted through 2017.<br />The mood should be ebullient. Data on everything from hiring to consumer spending to small business-owners’ confidence have bounced back and stayed above their pandemic lows.<br />Yet, for many money managers, the past few months have felt like anything but a straightforward win. After a 12-month period in which it seemed stocks could do nothing but go up, many say the outlook is growing increasingly opaque.<br />These days, “nothing really gets killed, but nothing really does that great,” said Andrew Slimmon, a managing director at  Morgan Stanley  Investment Management. “There’s no definable trend, [and] there’s little agreement in the market.”"
