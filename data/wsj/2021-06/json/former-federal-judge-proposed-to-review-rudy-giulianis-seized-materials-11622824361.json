    "body": "A Manhattan federal judge Friday said he would appoint retired federal judge Barbara S. Jones to serve as the outside authority tasked with reviewing materials seized in a criminal investigation into Rudy Giuliani’s dealings with Ukrainian officials.<br />U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken approved a proposal by prosecutors and Mr. Giuliani’s legal team to make Ms. Jones, now a partner at Bracewell LLP, a special master charged with identifying what is protected by attorney-client privilege and shouldn’t be used in the investigation.<br />“[H]er background and the resources available to her at her law firm will allow her to complete a privilege review in a fair and efficient manner,” federal prosecutors said in a letter filed Thursday. Prosecutors said that lawyers for Mr. Giuliani and his associate, lawyer Victoria Toensing, whose devices were also seized, agreed with the selection.<br />Robert Costello, a lawyer for Mr. Giuliani, said he looked forward to working with Ms. Jones. “Both the Mayor and I know Judge Jones and we both have total confidence that she will do her job in a thorough, fair and professional way,” he added.<br />A lawyer for Ms. Toensing and a spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment."
