    "body": "Regarding James A. Baker III’s “Focus on Principle, Not Personality, for a Bright GOP Future” (op-ed, June 7): While I’m not sure House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy is the man for the job, Republicans need only craft a new Contract With America, as famously done by Newt Gingrich in 1994.<br />Vigorously challenge the “woke” extremism, one point at a time. Federal takeover of elections? A power grab with two new states? Pack the Supreme Court? Young men (transitioning) competing in girls’ high-school sports? Street riots with no consequences? Daycare as infrastructure? Wide-open borders? Hatred of our founders? Teaching our children a new antiwhite racism? The Democratic Party embraces all of this; a majority of Americans support none of it.<br />Former President Trump’s bombast and narcissism brought us this mess. He won’t be able to supplant a unified party message. Like every GOP candidate or incumbent, he will have to be for or against it, period.<br />A new Contract With America—common sense for the American majority—with all the candidates for Congress on board, will win overwhelmingly.<br />Thomas V. Ward"
