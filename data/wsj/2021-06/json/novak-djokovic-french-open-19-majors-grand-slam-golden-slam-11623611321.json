    "body": "One day, one of these men’s tennis phenoms is really going to do it, vanquish one of the active, all-time greats, in the final of a major tournament, kicking off a fresh new era of the sport—wide open, unpredictable, no longer beholden to a hardy trio of legends.<br />Not just yet, however!<br />Sunday at Roland Garros, Novak Djokovic won another one for the old guys, roaring back from a two-set deficit to defeat 22-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to capture his second French Open and preserve the mostly-unbroken grip of the tricenarian “Big Three” (Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer) upon men’s tennis.<br />It was a master class in endurance and experience, Djokovic at his tenacious best. The elastic-limbed Serbian, who reached this clay court final by summiting what he calls the hardest mountain in tennis—Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros—remains perhaps the toughest out in all of sports. He’s a champion who cannot be declared kaput until the stadium staff are flipping off the lights, brushing the courts and rolling up the nets—and probably not even then, either.<br />Tennis has long known: Novak Djokovic is seldom really on the ropes."
