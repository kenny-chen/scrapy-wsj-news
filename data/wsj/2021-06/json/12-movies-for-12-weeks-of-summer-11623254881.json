    "body": "<br />Hollywood has a message for summer audiences: Don’t try this at home.<br />Welcome back to the movies. Not only are major action pictures headed for big-screen theatrical releases, so are the same kinds of niche documentaries and intimate dramas that flooded streaming platforms after theaters shut down last year.<br />The coming weeks mark the arrival of movies that have been circling Hollywood for months if not years.

But early signs of pent-up demand have given the industry reason for hope.<br />Here, 12 movies for the 12 weeks of summer."
