    "body": "In “ProPublica’s Plan for a Poorer America” (op-ed, June 17), Phil Gramm and Mike Solon discuss how Democrats are using information from ProPublica on the wealthiest Americans’ tax returns to push for a wealth tax that would lead to fewer jobs and lower pay. What the public, and apparently some Democrats, don’t seem to understand is that the tax code is a series of incentives. The government created tax laws to encourage specific activities that spur economic growth.<br />Put simply, the more income you earn, the more taxes you pay. The more assets (or wealth) you acquire, the less taxes you pay. Individuals like Elon Musk and Warren Buffett have essentially partnered with the government and now are reaping the benefits legally.<br />For example, rather than spending a lot of money trying to build up America’s green energy, it’s much cheaper for the government to provide tax benefits to Americans who support this initiative. President Biden now proposes new tax credits for solar and electric-vehicle charging stations. Any smart investor will respond to government incentives by adjusting his portfolio. That’s how the government achieves its goal.<br />A wealth tax would be a detriment to the government and America as a whole. Anyone who understands the nation’s tax law can see why these policies were written and how America’s top earners have benefited our economy.<br />Tom Wheelwright, CPA"
