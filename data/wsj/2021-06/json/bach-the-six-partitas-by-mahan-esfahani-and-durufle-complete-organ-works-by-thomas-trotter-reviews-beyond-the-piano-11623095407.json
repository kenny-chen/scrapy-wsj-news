    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Mahan Esfahani, whose new album, “Bach: The Six Partitas,” was just released on Hyperion, wants to restore the harpsichord to the classical mainstream, where its position was usurped two centuries ago by the piano. He’s been trying to transform its antiquated image in different ways, commissioning works from living composers and combining old and new music in performances, as he did to excellent effect on “Time Present and Time Past,” his 2015 album with the Baroque ensemble Concerto Köln for Archiv Produktion."
