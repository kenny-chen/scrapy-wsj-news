Every week, you will receive a greeting from one of us, a warm-up exercise to get you in a moneymaking mood, and a detailed step-by-step challenge. These are suitable for investors of any level, so play along even if you feel like a pro—there are insights you probably haven’t encountered.<br />Sign up for the newsletter and check out what we’ve created. And don’t forget to let me know what you think—I’ll be reading your emails.<br />Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com"
