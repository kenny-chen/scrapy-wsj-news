    "body": "Brooklyn, N.Y.<br />As they jostle to get ahead of each other in a crowded and anarchic primary, the Democratic candidates for New York mayor resemble a cluster of bumper cars.<br />As at any amusement park, getting ahead of the competition has been a matter of an inch here, a foot there: If it’s Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams one day, it’s the entrepreneur-cum-politico Andrew Yang the next. On other days, the lead has been with Kathryn Garcia, former head of the city’s Sanitation Department, and even Maya Wiley, who bounced close to the top of the heap this week after receiving an endorsement from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.<br />Viewed another way, no candidate in this perverse mayoral election has consistently led in the opinion polls—which this year have been desultory, even a little derelict. To be fair, the pollsters have struggled not only with canvassing opinion amid a pandemic, but also with the novel form of ranked-choice voting introduced for this election.<br />How do you conduct a call in which you ask an already impatient stranger—finger ready to disconnect—who his second, third and fourth choices are?"
