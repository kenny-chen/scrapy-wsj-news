    "body": "FALMOUTH, England—For British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Group of Seven summit that he hosted over the weekend was a major opportunity to showcase the U.K.’s ambitions on the global stage, putting its years inside the European Union decisively behind it.<br />But he couldn’t entirely make that happen. Wrangling over Brexit bled into the meeting, coloring what appeared to be a broadly successful summit.<br />The U.K. left the bloc last year following the 2016 Brexit referendum, and at the start of this year departed the bloc’s customs union and single market. That put into effect a convoluted deal to manage trade and preserve peace in Northern Ireland after Brexit that has since been the subject of a tense dispute between Mr. Johnson’s government and the EU.<br />The so-called Irish protocol avoided a border on the island of Ireland by creating in effect an economic border in the Irish Sea with customs and regulatory checks being carried out on goods sent to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. and with tariffs being levied on some products.<br />Mr. Johnson says the implementation of the deal threatens the territorial integrity of the U.K.; the EU, including Ireland, says Mr. Johnson signed the deal, so he should carry out what he agreed to."
