    "body": "A fight over access to a Hamptons beach is intensifying this summer, pitting wealthy homeowners seeking a serene oceanfront view against residents who want to drive trucks onto the sand.<br />Protests against a court order prohibiting people from driving on a roughly 4,000-foot oceanfront stretch of East Hampton known locally as “Truck Beach” could take place as soon as this weekend, a local fishermen says.<br />“We’ve caught a lot of fish on that beach, and I’m not going to stop doing it now because somebody doesn’t want to look at trucks,” said Danny Lester, a fisherman whose family for generations has worked the waters off this far southeastern part of Long Island, about 100 miles east of New York City. “If they stop us at the entrance and lock us up, so be it. We’re going down there, come hell or high water.”<br />The town has been fighting with the homeowners’ groups for 12 years, arguing that all residents should be allowed public access to the beach, including with vehicles. But town officials said the court’s temporary restraining order gives them no choice but to arrest or cite anyone who trespasses on the beach with a vehicle this summer season.<br />“We’re going to do whatever we have to to be in compliance with the judge’s order,” said East Hampton Supervisor Peter Van Scoyoc. “We have no choice but to enforce the trespass law.”"
