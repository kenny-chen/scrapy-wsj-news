    "body": "Have you dumped your Zoom group yet? If not, it’s probably only a matter of time.<br />Our virtual social lives are drying up. Zoom, Houseparty and other platforms that were a lifeline during the Covid-19 lockdowns now feel like a chore. Virtual gatherings are harder to schedule. The limitations are getting tougher to tolerate. Even long-lost friends who reconnected during the pandemic have lost interest in video chatting.<br />Zoom most certainly will continue as a workplace tool, but for socializing, “I think people will be ditching Zoom in droves,” predicts Richard Slatcher, a psychology professor at the University of Georgia. As the world opens up, virtual gatherings are proving no match for ones in real life.<br />In an April survey of 2,000 American adults conducted a year ago by the Siena College Research Institute, 60% said they had used video chat to talk with friends and family during the prior week. In April 2021, the share had dropped to 36%, according to Jeffrey Hall, a professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas, who commissioned the two surveys.<br />“We should keep in touch with our close friends, our best friends from college and high school. It is good for us,” Dr. Hall says. But we don’t."
