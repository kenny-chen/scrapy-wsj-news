    "body": "TOKYO—Japan’s Emperor Naruhito appears concerned the Tokyo Olympics will spread Covid-19, a senior aide said, a rare expression of opinion about current events by the imperial court.<br />The remarks Thursday by Yasuhiko Nishimura, grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency, came as infection rates in Japan trend higher again ahead of the opening of the Olympics on July 23.<br />“Amid public concern, I think that the emperor is worried that the Olympics could lead to an increase in infections,” Mr. Nishimura said, according to Japanese media. The Imperial Household Agency couldn’t be reached for comment.<br />Chief government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said he would ask the agency for more details but he said he viewed the remarks as the opinion of Mr. Nishimura. The grand steward said he was conveying what he believed was the emperor’s own view based on their conversations.<br />Olympic organizers say strict testing and hygiene rules for athletes and participants will ensure the Games don’t lead to a new surge in virus cases. Around 60,000 people are expected to travel to Japan from overseas for the event."
