    "body": "A woman on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Leon Black, the former chief executive of  Apollo Global Management Inc.,  accusing him of defamation and alleging he raped and harassed her.<br />The woman, Guzel Ganieva, with whom Mr. Black has said he had a consensual affair, claimed in the lawsuit that Mr. Black had mischaracterized their relationship and falsely accused her in media reports of trying to extort him after she initially posted her allegations in a series of tweets on March 17.<br />A spokesman for Mr. Black said he denies the claims.<br />Mr. Black stepped down earlier this year as CEO of Apollo and handed the reins to fellow co-founder Marc Rowan after revelations of Mr. Black’s ties to the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The credit and private-equity investment giant announced the leadership transition in January, saying Mr. Black would step down on or before his 70th birthday in July.<br />On March 22, Apollo made the unexpected announcement that Mr. Rowan would formally assume the CEO role and that Mr. Black would also cede the chairman role, handing it off to the firm’s lead independent director, former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton."
