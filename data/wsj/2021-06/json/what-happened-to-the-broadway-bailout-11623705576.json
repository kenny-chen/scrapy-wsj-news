    "body": "On Friday this column noted the predictable result that after lawmakers and central bankers initiated a multitrillion-dollar flood of Covid-related cash, various observers are advancing massive estimates of the amount of money ending up in criminal hands. But it’s important to note that the problem with government wealth redistributions is not just that huge sums stick to undeserving fingers. Such programs can also fail to offer timely assistance to the very people they are intended to help.<br />Take the example of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who has been bragging since last year about his success in engineering bailouts for the operators of entertainment venues. Yet somehow this taxpayer money doesn’t seem to be reaching many of the people Mr. Schumer intended to subsidize. Ben Sisario, Stacy Cowley and Julia Jacobs recently reported in the New York Times:<br />Last year Mr. Schumer warned that 90% of independent venues might die without emergency funding. Now, according to the Times, the government doesn’t believe that a number of the venue operators are alive:<br />Is it time to kill a federal program that can’t seem to provide help to the living?<br />***"
