    "body": "Investors have lost a bundle this year betting on solar-panel and wind-turbine makers. Their response: to double down.<br />A year ago, green stocks and the funds that track them rallied tremendously in the aftermath of the market’s recovery from a pandemic-induced swoon. Solar-panel and wind-turbine companies were among firms benefiting from a surge of investor- and consumer-driven demand for renewables, despite many being small unprofitable ventures.<br />This year, returns are trailing the broader stock market. That is thanks, in part, to stocks having run so far and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate course and how its actions may ultimately affect growth stocks.<br />Exchange-traded funds that track renewable-energy indexes have posted double-digit declines so far this year.  BlackRock ’s   has fallen 18% since December;  Invesco Ltd. ’s popular  has posted a 17% decline.<br />Even so, money continues to pour in. Professional money managers and individual traders alike have invested $6.2 billion into green-energy ETFs so far this year, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper. The inflows are on course to eclipse last year’s record $7.2 billion."
