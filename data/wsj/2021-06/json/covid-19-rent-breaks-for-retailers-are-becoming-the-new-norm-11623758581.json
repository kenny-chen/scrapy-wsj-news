    "body": "During the worst of the pandemic, many landlords offered deals where ailing retailers paid a percentage of their monthly sales in rent—rather than a fixed amount—to help them survive. Now, this once temporary way of charging tenants looks poised to outlast Covid-19.<br />More shopping-center owners are signing new leases where rent is tied directly to a portion of sales, at least for a period. These percentage-rent leases are especially attractive to newer retailers, offering some flexibility so that they aren’t saddled with large losses as they are starting out.<br />While most landlords tend to prefer the reliability of a fixed monthly rent payment, the wider use of percentage leases reflects how much retail has become a renters’ market.<br />Many retail businesses have struggled with competition from e-commerce, then took another blow when they faced pandemic-related lockdowns. Some didn’t survive, leaving landlords with excess space and compelling shopping-center owners to offer generous terms just to fill it.<br />“More brands are demanding it,” said Philippe Lanier, principal at EastBanc, a property developer, owner and manager of dozens of open-air retail properties in Washington, D.C.’s Georgetown neighborhood."
