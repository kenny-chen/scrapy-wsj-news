    "body": "<br />San Francisco<br />In a world afflicted by great loss over the past 15 months, there may be some who don’t much lament the long stifling endured by the performing arts. But for those multitudes who find incalculable reward in live performance, some recent stirrings in the Golden State prompt near exaltation.<br />Earlier this month, on June 6, Los Angeles Opera presented Stravinsky’s “Oedipus Rex” inside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with an orchestra, chorus and soloists totaling 99, nearly half unmasked, before an audience of 675 in a moving and timely performance.<br />Now, up north, the San Francisco Symphony has jumped-started the hitherto stalled inauguration of Esa-Pekka Salonen’s music directorship. Mr. Salonen’s tenure was to have begun last fall with a host of inventive programming and a much-touted partnership with eight cutting-edge cultural figures. But the pandemic thwarted those plans. Instead, the recently European-based Mr. Salonen has made an unexpected return to the U.S. to lead several programs throughout the summer that are neither part of the scrapped 2020-21 season nor an early start to the soon-to-be announced 2021-22 season."
