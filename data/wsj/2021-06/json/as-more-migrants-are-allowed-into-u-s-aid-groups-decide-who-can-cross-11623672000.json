    "body": "TIJUANA, MEXICO—The U.S. government is letting hundreds of people enter the country each day to request asylum under a new plan that relies on aid groups to choose who can cross the border.<br />These growing numbers of migrants are being allowed in as part of a broader move by the Biden administration to relax the 15-month shutdown of the border with Mexico that is still officially in place.<br />The nongovernmental organizations have been largely left to rely on their own judgment to decide who should get exceptions to enter the U.S. because they are among the most vulnerable. The American government has said priority should be given to families and those who are vulnerable for reasons such as medical needs, LGBTQ status or having been targeted by criminal groups.<br />“There’s no question that an exemption process that asks NGOs to rank families by how desperate they are is going to ultimately be arbitrary and depend on who they encounter,” said Lee Gelernt, an immigration attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.<br />The exceptions are being made under agreements with the ACLU and numerous aid groups that have sued the government over its border policies."
