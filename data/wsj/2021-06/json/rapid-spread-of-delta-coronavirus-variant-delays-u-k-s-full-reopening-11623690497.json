    "body": "LONDON—U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson delayed a long-awaited end to Covid-19 restrictions in England following an upswing in cases of a more contagious variant of coronavirus, highlighting how the virus can spread even within highly vaccinated populations.<br />The four-week delay offers a cautionary lesson to the U.S. and other countries about the risk of further outbreaks caused by new forms of the virus that are spreading around the world. The variant is primarily spreading among younger, unvaccinated groups in Britain but cases have been detected among older people who have had one and sometimes two doses of vaccine.<br />The delay will allow the government to administer more shots and give public-health officials extra time to assess if vaccines are doing the job of preventing rising caseloads from resulting in packed hospitals and more deaths.<br />“Now is the time to ease off the accelerator,” Mr. Johnson said at a news conference. “By being cautious now, we have the chance in the next four weeks to save many thousands of lives by vaccinating millions of people.”<br />The emerging evidence from the U.K. suggests that the variant known as Delta, which was first detected during a huge wave of infection in India earlier this year, is considerably more transmissible than older strains of the virus and that infection is more likely to result in hospitalization."
