    "body": "With the stock market at or near record highs and so much good news baked into stock valuations, many investors are wondering whether we are due for a market correction. History has little to teach us there. Again and again, investors who try to time markets typically get it wrong.<br />But history offers us a valuable lesson as to what happens—and which stocks best survive—when prolonged declines do occur. Many people assume it is the highflying stocks that suffer most in a correction or bear market, but we found it is the opposite group that falls the most when markets tumble.<br />To explore this issue, my research assistant, Elan Guzman, and I dug into market data from 11 occurrences over the past 30 years in which the S&P 500 fell 10% or more before returning to its former high. The median length of these downturns was 65 days.<br />Using all Nasdaq- and NYSE-listed companies as our universe, we looked at returns for each stock over a one-year period up to the start of each correction. From this data, we identified the companies that made up the top 25% in terms of returns and labeled them “winners.” We also found the bottom 25% and labeled those “losers.”<br />Next, we looked at how those two groups performed during the downturns to determine which one suffered less during those periods."
