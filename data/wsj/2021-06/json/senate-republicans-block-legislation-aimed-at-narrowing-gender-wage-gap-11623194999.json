    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Senate Republicans blocked legislation aimed at narrowing the gender-based wage gap, marking the second filibuster of this year.<br />The vote was 49-50 on a procedural motion to take up the legislation, with Democrats voting yes and all Republicans voting no. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) was absent, but even had she voted, Democrats would have fallen short of the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican opposition.<br />(More to come.)<br />Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com"
