    "body": "Replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen in the economy is a bit like doing a jigsaw puzzle: Once a few early pieces are connected, it will be much easier to fit the others. A plan from one of the world’s top wind-turbine makers can help.<br />Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy ,  in cooperation with its controlling shareholder,  Siemens Energy ,  will create wind turbines that also produce hydrogen. They have an onshore demonstration facility in Denmark and offshore projects in the works. Siemens Gamesa published a white paper on Wednesday outlining how its wind-to-hydrogen solution could help reduce costs.<br />Green hydrogen is a crucial ingredient in policies to cut carbon emissions to the net-zero benchmark by 2050. It has the capacity to decarbonize difficult-to-electrify sectors, such as steel production, while providing long-term storage for renewable energy and making it transportable, similar to oil and gas today.<br />The big hurdle is that green hydrogen—formed by splitting water in a renewable-powered electrolyzer—currently costs many times more than so-called gray, made from fossil fuels, and even blue, which is gray with its emissions captured. The promise of cost parity would attract not just current buyers of gray hydrogen but also industrial users of fossil fuels. These need a high level of visibility over future costs to convert their facilities.<br />Siemens Gamesa expects to produce green hydrogen at a cost in line with gray hydrogen by 2030 onshore and 2035 offshore. Producing hydrogen near the power source avoids costs and power losses associated with transmission cables. Instead, hydrogen travels down pipelines which are about one-tenth the cost of power distribution and more scalable."
