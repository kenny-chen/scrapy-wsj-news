    "body": "ST. LOUIS—Simone Biles was such an obvious lock for the Olympic team that she might have been able to arrive at the Dome at America’s Center, sit back and wait to be thrown a uniform. She is, after all, undefeated in all-around competition since 2013, with five Olympic medals and 25 world medals to her name.<br />That isn’t the Simone Biles way, though. The 24-year-old treated trials as a full-on competition of the kind that’s been hard to come by for the past year and a half. And in doing so, she both reaffirmed her status as the sport’s greatest ever and hinted at the pressures on her.<br />On the first night of competition, Biled brought back out her double-twisting double-somersault dismount on the balance beam, among other stellar moments, to have one of her highest all-around scores in years.<br />On the second night, however, she expressed visible disappointment at performances that were subpar only for Simone Biles.<br />She was annoyed at imperfect vault landings on her first rotation, then stayed on the uneven bars after a close shave. She took a fall on the balance beam. Biles pressed on and completed her floor routine with her usual high-powered tumbling, though less-than-polished landings, to easily clinch her spot at the top of the scoreboard and the U.S. Olympic roster."
