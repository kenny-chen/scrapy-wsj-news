    "body": "ISLAMABAD—Many countries offer incentives to entice people to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Pakistan is taking a more punitive approach.<br />Authorities in this country of 220 million threaten those refusing to accept the shot with punishments from cutting off their cellphone connections to withholding their salaries.<br />The penalties contrast with the prizes being dangled elsewhere in the world. A town in the Philippines is offering people who agree to be vaccinated the chance to win a cow. Some U.S. states are holding  lotteries with cash prizes, while Hong Kong is giving away a multimillion-dollar apartment.<br />Pakistan’s punitive measures vary by region—health services are largely the responsibility of the country’s four provinces—but the federal government has also announced penalties, all meant to prod a populace long suspicious of vaccines. Pakistan is one of only two countries where polio remains endemic, due largely to skepticism over the polio vaccine.<br />Haider Ali, a 26-year-old car mechanic in the capital, Islamabad, said he wouldn’t take the Covid-19 vaccine and isn’t sure the coronavirus even exists."
