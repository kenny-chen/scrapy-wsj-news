    "body": "Despite the advance of cultural wokeness, the Democratic Party’s progressive wing finds itself embattled on two fronts, each with the same opponent: skeptical voters.<br />In Congress, President Biden’s so-called infrastructure bill, the American Jobs Plan, is struggling to succeed as the warm-up act for progressivism’s star attraction—Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders’s $6 trillion lollapalooza of spending for everything imaginable. Anticipating the worst, voters produced a 50-50 Senate. The American left’s utopia is on hold in Congress.<br />The second front is as far from utopia as one can imagine—the U.S.’s troubled urban centers of violence, homelessness and homicide.<br />On Tuesday, New York City’s voters went to the polls in the Democratic mayoral primary. In post-pandemic Gotham this vote was about just one thing: crime.<br />Before the Covid-19 pandemic closed down the world, New York’s annual tourist traffic numbered about 60 million, an incomprehensible crush of eager humanity. A big reason they kept coming is that over the two pro-police mayoral terms of Rudy Giuliani and Mike Bloomberg, New York became arguably the world’s safest major city. You could go anywhere. Today the city of 8.4 million is on edge."
