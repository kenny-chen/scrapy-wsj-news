    "body": "New Yorkers will head to the polls Tuesday to determine the next mayor of New York City and the winners in dozens of other primary races, but many contests might not be called for weeks.<br />The Democratic mayoral primary features 13 candidates. The winner will likely go on to take the general election in the fall as Democrats outnumber Republicans by roughly 6 to 1 in the city. Two candidates are running in the Republican mayoral primary.<br />Hundreds of candidates are also competing in primaries to determine seats in the City Council and for the offices of comptroller, public advocate and borough president.<br />The city will use ranked-choice voting for the first time in the mayoral primaries and in most of the other races. The new system allows voters to list up to five candidates in a race in preferential order.<br />Recent polls show there are still undecided voters in the Democratic mayoral race."
