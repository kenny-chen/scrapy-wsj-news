    "body": "As the world’s biggest asset managers gear up to make inroads into China’s mutual-fund industry,  Invesco Ltd.  has its eyes on a different prize.<br />The Atlanta-based investment firm is hoping to manage a piece of China’s national pension fund, betting its nearly two-decade record of investing ordinary Chinese citizens’ money could help it win the coveted job.<br />“We would like to be a manager for the social-security fund,” Invesco Asia-Pacific Chief Executive Andrew Lo said in an interview, referring to the $400 billion-plus reserve fund created by the Chinese government to supplement and support the financial needs of the country’s pensioners.<br />Invesco Great Wall Fund Management, the firm’s China joint venture, “will be in a good position to be qualified” when the national pension reserve fund is ready to onboard new managers, Mr. Lo said. He added that he hopes that could happen within the next two years. The last time new investment mandates were allocated for yuan-denominated assets was in 2010.<br />Invesco’s ambition, which contrasts with that of its bigger U.S. rivals, extends the unique path that the 85-year-old American firm has charted in China."
