    "body": "U.S. health regulators have authorized newer, more convenient forms of a Covid-19 antibody drug made by  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.  that could make it easier for patients to get the treatment, the company said on Friday.<br />Doctors and nurses now can administer one of the new forms by a simple injection, rather than intravenous infusion.<br />Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody drug, called REGEN-COV, has been available to treat recently diagnosed Covid-19 since last November under an emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In clinical trials, the drug reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 70% in people with mild to moderate symptoms.<br />Yet the drug has gone underused, according to public health officials, in part because it requires intravenous infusions that not all clinics and hospitals are equipped to administer.<br />Under the new authorization, the FDA permitted a simpler formulation, in which patients receive an injection shot underneath the skin in cases where IV infusions aren’t feasible or would lead to a delay in treatment, Regeneron said."
