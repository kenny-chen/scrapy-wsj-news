    "body": "For years, Ireland has prospered from rock-bottom tax rates that have drawn some of the biggest U.S. companies to set up large operations on its shores.<br />Now, an effort led by the U.S. to stop tax-avoidance schemes is threatening Dublin, as Washington seeks an international agreement setting a minimum tax rate for big multinational corporations, and reallocating the right to tax some profits to countries where goods and services are sold, rather than where they are made.<br />Over the past two decades, multinational businesses have flocked to Ireland, drawn by a corporate tax rate of just 12.5%. Most of the U.S. digital giants use the country as their European headquarters. Nine of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies have significant operations in the country, often making drugs that are sold to the U.S.<br />Ireland’s low tax rate has helped attract many of the new breed of footloose digital giants that don’t need to be close to consumers to sell to them, and can register their intellectual property—from which their profits derive—just about anywhere.<br />Now, the U.S. is leading a charge to set a minimum tax rate of 15% on corporate profits, a plan that gained fresh support from the Group of Seven countries meeting in the U.K. this weekend."
