    "body": "References to critical race theory have become more prominent and controversial over the past year. Such references have been the subject of fights over school curricula at the state, local and federal level. There has also been debate over whether elements of critical race theory should be included in both public- and private-sector workforce training.<br />Here’s an explanation of the theory, and an overview of some of the debates that have referenced it.<br />Critical race theory is an academic concept first developed by legal scholars in the early 1970s. It argues the legacy of white supremacy remains embedded in modern-day society through laws and institutions that were fundamental in shaping American society. Generally speaking, it rejects the idea that laws are inherently neutral, even if they are sometimes applied unevenly.<br />Its backers say that American society, framed by the Constitution, gives a leg up to white people—but that it could be made more equitable if more white people acknowledge societal advantages of having been born white.<br />“Critical race theory is a radical departure from the way in which the law analyzed constitutional and political issues,” said Luke Harris, an associate professor of American politics and Constitutional law at Vassar College in New York."
