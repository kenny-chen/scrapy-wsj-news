    "body": "There’s an old saying: If you see a duck riding a bicycle, and I see a duck riding a bicycle, sometimes you still need the Supreme Court to unanimously say that it sees a duck riding a bicycle, too.<br />OK. Fine. “Duck on a Bike” may be the title of a children’s book by David Shannon, but the above is not an old saying. I made it up.<br />Still, that’s effectively what happened Monday, as the nation’s highest court confirmed what any reasonable person can see, that big-time intercollegiate athletics is a warped, hard-to-defend product.<br />We all knew this, of course. The big numbers are right in our faces. By now, everyone’s read about the billion-dollar network deals; the millionaire coaches sheltered by eight-figure buyouts; the assistants out-earning school presidents; the gilded facilities with world-class weight rooms and wellness lounges appointed like five-star resorts.<br />Schools weren’t embarrassed by this spending—they bragged about it. As they barred their own athletes from sharing the cash, they touted coaching hires flown in by private jet, and locker rooms with theater seats and flat screen TVs."
