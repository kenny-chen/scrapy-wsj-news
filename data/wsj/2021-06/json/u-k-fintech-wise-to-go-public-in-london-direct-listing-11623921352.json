    "body": "Wise, an online money-transfer service, kicked off plans to list on the  London Stock Exchange ,  taking advantage of surging investor interest in financial technology companies.<br />The U.K.-based startup, formerly known as TransferWise, didn’t disclose a target valuation for the initial public offering, but it could reach between $6 billion and $7 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />The company was founded a decade ago by Estonian entrepreneurs Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Käärmann. More than 10 million customers use Wise’s money-transfer service. It aims to make it easier and cheaper to move money across borders and into different currencies than with a bank.<br />“We were both sick of losing money to our banks,” Mr. Käärmann told journalists Thursday about why he and Mr. Hinrikus started Wise in 2011.<br />Wise charged an average price of 0.68% of the amount of money transferred in the first quarter of 2021. Credit cards and banks have traditionally charged several percentage points for similar transactions."
