These included efforts to calm market turmoil, suppress borrowing costs and lend money directly to some businesses and local governments. The programs wound down at the end of 2020.<br />Mr. Powell said the lending programs “helped unlock more than $2 trillion of funding” that reduced job losses at businesses, nonprofits and local governments."
