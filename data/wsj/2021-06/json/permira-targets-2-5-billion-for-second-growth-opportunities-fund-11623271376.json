    "body": "Permira aims to raise some $2.5 billion for its second growth fund focused on investments in smaller, growing technology companies, people familiar with the fund said.<br />If the London-based firm hits its target, the new fund would be 47% larger than its predecessor. Its first growth technology vehicle, Permira Growth Opportunities I LP, closed with $1.7 billion in July 2019.<br />Overall, Permira backs investments in consumer, healthcare, technology and services companies, according to the firm’s website. The firm invests in buyouts through its main private-equity funds and raised €11 billion (the equivalent of around $13.39 billion) for the latest, Permira VII LP, in the fall of 2019.<br />Its growth opportunities funds, however, typically focus on minority positions in companies that don’t fit the mandate of its flagship funds, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported. The strategy has a particular focus on technology and digital companies, the firm’s website stated.<br />Permira has backed at least eight companies through its growth strategy, the website indicates. Most recently, the firm led the $180 million Series D funding round for Nexthink SA, which valued the Switzerland-based digital employee-management software provider at $1.1 billion."
