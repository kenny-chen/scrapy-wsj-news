    "body": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday seized on the fatal shooting of a 10-year-old boy to call for stricter federal gun control and to push for state legislation that would provide more assistance to parolees.<br />The shooting of Justin Wallace inside a home in the Far Rockaway section of Queens on Saturday was the result of a flood of guns entering the city amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference.<br />New York Police Department officials said the boy might have been the unintended victim of a shooting after a gunman opened fire on the home. Detectives were investigating the case and no arrests had been made, according to the officials.<br />The number of shootings and homicides in New York and other U.S. cities has increased sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />NYPD officers have made 28% more arrests for gun-related crimes so far in 2021, compared with the same time last year, but the number of shootings in the city has continued to climb, according to Mr. de Blasio. The NYPD recorded 602 shootings from Jan. 1 through June 6, up 68% from the 358 shootings during the same period in 2020."
