Moderna said Thursday it has asked U.S. health regulators to authorize the use of its shot for those aged 12 to 17 as Americans continue to get vaccinated. Moderna and  Pfizer  also are studying their shots in children younger than age 12, and the companies said initial results from that testing could be available by the fall. Moderna shares fell 0.2% Thursday.<br />Apple  Inc.<br />Apple is taking another bite out of the digital-advertising industry. Chief Executive Tim Cook kicked off the company’s weeklong Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday by announcing new features to help users control how their online data is used by third parties. Those changes, which will be introduced later this year, allow users to deny the ability of marketers to see if and when an email is opened through Apple’s Mail app and to hide IP address information to prevent tracking web usage on the Safari browser. This comes a year after Apple angered software developers by saying it would make it harder to track iPhone users’ digital footprints. Apple shares ended flat Monday and rose 0.7% Tuesday.<br />GameStop  Corp."
