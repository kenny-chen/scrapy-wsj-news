    "body": "Boston’s office market has become the envy of landlords across the country, thanks to its expanding biotech and other life-sciences companies awash in capital.<br />Life sciences was a hot commercial-property niche even before the pandemic. But its growth went into overdrive as billions of dollars began pouring into vaccines, and the vaccines proved effective in taming the virus.<br />In the latest example, real-estate investment firm Marcus Partners recently said it would develop a 228,000-square-foot complex in Boston’s Seaport District with Ginkgo Bioworks leasing most of the space.<br />Other life-sciences projects either under construction or in planning could double the size of the sector in the Boston region to more than 60 million square feet in the next decade, according to  Colliers International Group Inc.,  a commercial-real-estate-services firm.<br />While office landlords in New York City, San Francisco and Chicago are struggling with falling rents, rising vacancy rates and the uncertainty of whether businesses will return, the booming life-sciences business gives Boston an edge."
