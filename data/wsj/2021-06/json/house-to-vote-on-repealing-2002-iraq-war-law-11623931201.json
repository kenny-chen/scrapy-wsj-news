    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House is expected to vote Thursday to revoke the 2002 law that authorized war in Iraq, reviving a long-simmering debate over Congress’s constitutional power to declare war and the commander in chief’s latitude to send American troops into combat abroad.<br />The measure is expected to pass with bipartisan support, reflecting the growing unpopularity among American voters with the so-called forever wars.<br />The Biden administration said in a statement Monday that it supported termination of the 2002 authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF.<br />The U.S. has no continuing military activities that rely solely on the 2002 authorization, and the repeal likely would have “minimal impact on current military operations,” the statement said. President Barack Obama pulled U.S. troops out of Iraq in 2011, although a contingent returned later to aid the Iraqi government’s fight against Islamic State.<br />Similar legislation in the Senate is expected to get a vote on June 22 in the Committee on Foreign Relations. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) voiced his support for repealing the 2002 AUMF and pledged to bring the matter to the floor for a vote this year."
