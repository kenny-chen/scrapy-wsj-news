    "body": "An arbitrator has rejected a former top  Cedar Realty Trust  executive’s claims of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation against the chief executive officer of the publicly listed shopping-center landlord.<br />Nancy Mozzachio, Cedar’s chief operating officer from 2014 to 2016, alleged in a 2017 state court lawsuit in Brooklyn, N.Y., that CEO Bruce Schanzer wrongfully fired her after she threatened to consult a lawyer about reporting sexual harassment. She also said in the suit that Mr. Schanzer repeatedly leered at her and other female employees and made inappropriate comments.<br />Mr. Schanzer denied the allegations. In 2018, Cedar Realty’s board said that an independent investigation found no merit to Ms. Mozzachio’s complaints and that her “suit is nothing more than a calculated maneuver to do an end-run around pre-existing arbitration and to harass and harm Mr. Schanzer.”<br />The 2017 lawsuit was later referred to private arbitration because the terms of her employment contract required it.<br />In a ruling handed down in December 2019 and unsealed in May, the arbitrator said Cedar Realty had legitimate reasons for terminating Ms. Mozzachio, and denied her other claims."
