    "body": "Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease authority, said he never played down the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could have been leaked from a lab in China, calling accusations he did so for political reasons “preposterous.”<br />Speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s Tech Health event, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that when scientists who had studied the virus floated the idea in February 2020 that it could have been “manipulated,” he quickly gathered a group of scientists together.<br />After further examination, he said, the scientists reached the conclusion that the most likely scenario was that the virus that causes Covid-19 had jumped from animals to humans. He said he remains open-minded about the origin of the virus.<br />“Until you nail it down definitively, you always have to keep an open mind that it might be something else,” Dr. Fauci said. “And that’s the way I have always been from the very beginning, I have not changed my mind.”<br />Dr. Fauci was informed as early as February 2020 that Covid-19 exhibited unusual viral characteristics that suggested it could have potentially been engineered in a lab, according to emails recently obtained by the Washington Post and BuzzFeed."
