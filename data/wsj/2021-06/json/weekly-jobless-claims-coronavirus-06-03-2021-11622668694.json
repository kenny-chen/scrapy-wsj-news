    "body": "Worker filings for unemployment benefits likely fell again last week, adding to signs of a healing labor market as the U.S. economy ramps up.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast that weekly unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, declined below 400,000 last week from 406,000 the prior week. That level would mark the fewest claims since the Covid-19 crisis began last year and the fifth straight week claims have reached a fresh pandemic low.<br />Economists separately expect that the May employment report, set to be released on Friday, will show that the economy added 674,000 jobs last month, after gaining 266,000 in April, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.9% in May from 6.1% the prior month.<br />The expected labor-market developments would point to a budding economic expansion as rising vaccination rates quell Covid-19 case numbers and governments ease restrictions on businesses.<br />“We’ve heard a lot about workers being slow to rejoin the workforce and some reluctance to take the jobs that are available, but on the other side of that, the recovery is proceeding [and] layoffs are declining,” Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said. She expects the number of initial jobless claims to have slipped to 390,000 last week."
