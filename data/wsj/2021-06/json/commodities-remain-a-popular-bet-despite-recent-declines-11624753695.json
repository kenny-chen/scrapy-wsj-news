    "body": "Many commodities from copper to lumber have dropped from their peak pandemic prices, easing the most acute worries about an inflationary spiral. But investors remain bullish on many of them, arguing they still look cheap.<br />Copper is down 10% from a record it hit in March. Front-month futures for corn and soybeans are off their May highs by 13% and 19%, respectively. Hogs have lost 17% this month.<br />Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said lumber’s dramatic arc showed how the sky-high materials costs that characterized the reopening economy were the result of supply bottlenecks and other factors that aren’t expected to last as the world’s economies move further from lockdown. Lumber futures have fallen 54% after shooting up to more than four times the average price during the most recent springs before the pandemic.<br />“A few months ago the consensus was that prices for commodities can’t go anywhere but up,” said Richard Dunbar, head of multiasset research at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “More recently, though, we’ve had a few reminders that prices don’t go up in a straight line.”<br />Despite the recent drop, lumber remains twice the typical price for this time of year. Copper, row crops and swine are still around their highest prices in years. Oil and natural gas, laggards of the reopening, have risen sharply to their highest levels since 2018."
