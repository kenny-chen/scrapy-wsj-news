    "body": "In a recent Wall Street Journal article, reporter Laura Kusisto detailed her dangerous postpartum experience, in which a life-threatening infection landed her back in the hospital two weeks after delivering a healthy baby boy. Readers wrote in to share their own experiences in response.<br /><br /><br />I was hospitalized 22 days after giving birth to my son this past December and also diagnosed with sepsis. I remember the days leading up to my hospitalization. Every symptom I googled was listed as a normal part of postpartum, so it took a fever and a near-fainting spell to finally get me to call my doctor. All I could think in those first six weeks was: “How is there no care during this time?” And I say this as someone who thinks very highly of my OB and who received incredible care throughout my pregnancy and when I was readmitted.<br />Lauren Palazzo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPortland, Maine"
