    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Food and Drug Administration is making millions of  Johnson & Johnson  Covid-19 vaccine doses available for export from a Baltimore factory that had been beset by contamination problems.<br />A review determined that two batches of vaccines produced at the Baltimore plant run by  Emergent BioSolutions Inc.  were suitable for use, the FDA said Friday.<br />The agency also said that it wasn’t yet ready to designate the plant as an authorized manufacturing facility, and “continues to work through issues there” with J&J and Emergent.<br />The two batches cleared for use will provide about 10 million doses, according to people familiar with the situation. About 60 million doses were rejected for potential contamination, one of these people said, confirming a report in the New York Times.<br />With those rejections, there are about 120 million vaccine doses and unbottled substance made for J&J and  AstraZeneca  PLC at the Baltimore plant that could be cleared in coming weeks and be available for export, according to this person, a senior U.S. official."
