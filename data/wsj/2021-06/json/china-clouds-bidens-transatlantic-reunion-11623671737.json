    "body": "Of all the differences between the U.S. and its allies in Europe, how to deal with China is the most intractable.<br />Fresh from the G-7 love-in in Britain, President Biden is in Brussels this week to meet NATO and European Union leaders. There will no doubt be more warm words of trans-Atlantic harmony on subjects such as Covid-19, climate change and the importance of democracy.<br />Under the surface, points of disagreement remain. On longstanding issues such as European military spending, digital taxes, steel tariffs and subsidies for  Boeing  and  Airbus ,  diplomacy can probably bring progress. Where it will struggle to make meaningful headway is in reconciling different attitudes to China.<br />The weekend’s G-7 communiqué was mainly hawkish on China, but the accompanying commentary highlighted the balancing act the EU has to pull off. European leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Mario Draghi stressed the need to cooperate with Beijing.<br />Attitudes in Brussels toward the Asian nation have hardened, just as they have in Washington. In 2019, the EU took a big step and labeled China a “systemic rival.” It has since established powers to screen foreign investments and proposed new rules to block takeovers by government-subsidized companies. Central and Eastern European nations have also cooled on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative."
