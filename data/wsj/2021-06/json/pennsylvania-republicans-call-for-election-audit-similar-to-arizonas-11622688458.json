    "body": "PHOENIX—Pennsylvania GOP lawmakers visited an ongoing Republican-ordered audit of 2020 ballots here Wednesday and called for their state to conduct a similar review, the latest sign that political fighting over last year’s election is far from over.<br />Republicans in Arizona’s senate ordered the audit of roughly 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, that began in April. President Biden won Arizona by just over 10,000 votes out of more than 3.3 million cast statewide, in part due to a roughly two-percentage-point victory in Maricopa.<br />On Wednesday, three Republican state lawmakers from Pennsylvania toured the audit site, at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix, and met with several Arizona GOP lawmakers to discuss election issues, according to Arizona Republican state Sen. Wendy Rogers, who tweeted about the visit.<br />Pennsylvania Republican Cris Dush, a freshman senator from the north central part of the state, said he would like to see his state undertake a similar audit of 2020 ballots, which supporters say is meant to provide transparency. “Forty-seven percent of the people in this country don’t have faith in the electoral—electoral integrity right now,” Mr. Dush said in an interview. “And my constituents are very much up in arms, with the lack of any movement on trying to find out what happened.”<br />Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a Republican, also called for Pennsylvania to conduct an audit, which he said could potentially focus on one county that leaned Republican and another that leaned Democratic. Mr. Biden won the state last year. “I’m not about overturning anything,” he said. “I’m just trying to find out what went right, what went wrong? And how do we have better elections in the future?”"
