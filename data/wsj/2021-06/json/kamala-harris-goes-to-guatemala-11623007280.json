    "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris visits Guatemala on Monday as part of her effort to address the “root causes” of migration from Central America’s Northern Triangle—which also includes El Salvador and Honduras. One of Ms. Harris’s goals is to drum up investment for the region.<br />Manage your expectations.<br />Count on lots of glad-handing with politicians, activists from nongovernmental organizations, and slippery businessmen who know a thing or two about political entrepreneurship.<br />The unseen will matter more. For Guatemala that’s big numbers of small and medium-size investors, foreign and domestic, who are necessary for development but are not on board with Ms. Harris because they distrust her agenda.<br />Guatemalan politics are highly charged, polarized and corrupt. One side, with backers in Washington, applauds land invasions, electricity theft and road blocks in the name of social justice. For the antidevelopment left, in Guatemala and in the American Democratic Party, the rule of law in the developing world is a nuisance."
