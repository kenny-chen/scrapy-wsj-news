    "body": "The eight candidates for Manhattan district attorney spent the final day before the Democratic primary election trying to sway undecided voters in a race with no clear front-runner.<br />Alvin Bragg and Tali Farhadian Weinstein have emerged as the two leading contenders in a crowded field, leading in fundraising and receiving big-name endorsements. The winner of the Democratic primary will be the heavy favorite to succeed incumbent Cyrus Vance Jr., a three-term Democrat who isn’t running for re-election, in heavily Democratic Manhattan.<br />Mr. Bragg, a former federal prosecutor and deputy attorney general, was endorsed by Rachael Rollins, the Boston-area district attorney who is considered a leader among progressive prosecutors. Mr. Bragg spent Monday morning speaking with voters at city subway stations and encouraging people to vote in Union Square, where he ran into another candidate, Lucy Lang.<br />“You get out in the streets and you never know who you’re going to see,” said Mr. Bragg. “Go out and vote.”<br />Ms. Farhadian Weinstein, a former Justice Department official and counsel to Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, had breakfast Monday in Chinatown with community leaders before meeting with voters on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and Upper West Side, according to a campaign spokeswoman."
