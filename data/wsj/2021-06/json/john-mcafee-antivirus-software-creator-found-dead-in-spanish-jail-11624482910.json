    "body": "John McAfee, the antivirus software pioneer who founded cybersecurity company McAfee, was found dead Wednesday in a jail cell in Spain, according to a statement from his attorney.<br />A Spanish court earlier in the day ordered for the extradition of Mr. McAfee in connection with a federal criminal proceeding in Tennessee. Mr. McAfee had been detained in the country since October in connection with criminal charges filed in Tennessee by the Justice Department’s tax division.<br />The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office also sought the extradition of Mr. McAfee for a separate criminal case.<br />“John was and will always be remembered as a fighter,” said Nishay K. Sanan, an attorney for Mr. McAfee. “He tried to love this country but the U.S. government made his existence impossible.”<br />Mr. Sanan said the court ruling Wednesday was going to be appealed in the next few days and that the New York extradition was still pending in a lower court in Spain."
