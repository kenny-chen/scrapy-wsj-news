    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden plans to open a sales pitch this week for the roads, bridges and broadband at the center of the bipartisan infrastructure deal, seeking to shift the focus away from its complicated legislative path in Congress and his own messaging stumbles.<br />Mr. Biden will travel to La Crosse, Wis., on Tuesday to highlight ways he believes the plan negotiated with Republicans and Democrats would bolster the economy and help families and small businesses. Wisconsin is a top presidential battleground and was narrowly carried by Mr. Biden in 2020. It is also home to Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), one of the most vulnerable Republican senators seeking re-election next year.<br />The White House has backed both the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure deal and a separate, broader antipoverty effort that could cost trillions more and is expected to draw only Democratic support.<br />Mr. Biden is seeking to put the focus back on the contents of his agenda, and leaving the process and timing to Congress, after he was forced to back away from issuing a veto threat to the infrastructure bill if it isn’t tied directly to the larger partisan bill. Some Republican senators had said that threat could undermine their support.<br />Underscoring the fight over the two tracks, in a statement Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Mr. Biden should push congressional Democratic leaders to also delink the fate of the bipartisan bill from the broader antipoverty plan."
