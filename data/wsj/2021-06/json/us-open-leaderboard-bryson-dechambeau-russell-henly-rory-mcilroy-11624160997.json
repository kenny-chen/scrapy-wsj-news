    "body": "SAN DIEGO—The players at the top of the leaderboard at the U.S. Open have an interesting perspective on what it’s like to be within striking distance of a major win.<br />Mackenzie Hughes, a 30-year-old Canadian who previously missed the cut in six of his eight career majors, was a 500-to-1 longshot to win this U.S. Open. Russell Henley, a 32-year-old American, was 200-to-1 and has never finished in the top 10 of one. Louis Oosthuizen is a 38-year-old South African who’s famous for being the rare golfer to finish second in every major championship.<br />“You always wonder what it would feel like or be like to be in contention,” Henley said.<br />These are the unexpected underdogs who are tied for first entering the final round at Torrey Pines Golf Course. But the growing excitement here doesn’t simply have to do with Oosthuizen’s improbable eagle on the 18th hole Saturday or the other shots that put this trio at the top.<br />It’s because of the cornucopia of fascinating players angling to chase these three down."
