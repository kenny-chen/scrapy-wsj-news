    "body": "For years, the post-Olympic tour was a showcase for USA Gymnastics, a traveling spectacle of highly decorated heroines flanked by male gymnasts, rhythmic gymnasts, trampoline gymnasts and acrobatic gymnasts.<br />But after this summer’s Tokyo Olympics, there will be no USA Gymnastics tour. In its place will be a new one—with one clear star, and without the men.<br />Simone Biles is headlining her own 35-city extravaganza—the Gold Over America Tour, a not-so-subtle play on the acronym ‘GOAT’ (Greatest of All Time) associated with the Olympic and five-time world all-around champion who is now performing some of the most difficult gymnastics ever.<br />The 24-year-old, who on Sunday night won a record seventh national all-around title, is the face of the tour just as athletes on other blockbuster U.S. women’s teams—basketball and soccer—have sought to shape the events that used to be controlled by their sports’ governing bodies with little input from those who performed in them.<br />Biles announced her intention to do the tour at the end of 2019. The fact that the tour schedule was unveiled two months before any medals are awarded at the Tokyo Games—which themselves are threatened by the Covid-19 pandemic—speaks to her confidence and broad popularity."
