    "body": "New York City will install its first curbside electric-vehicle charging stations this year, part of an effort to address the dearth of charging options in the city.<br />The Department of Transportation said that by October it will install 100 charging ports for public use. Another 20 ports will serve the city’s fleet of electric vehicles.<br />City officials said the expansion of an electric-vehicle charging network would be essential to meeting its environmental goals, which include reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.<br />“If New York City is going to reduce and ultimately eliminate its carbon footprint, it’s critical that whatever cars exist in the city be electric,” NYC DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said. He said the pilot program, which will run for four years, was a start.<br />“Our plan is to go big on this,” he said. “And we assume the private sector is going to step up and do its part.”"
