    "body": "The number of workers seeking unemployment benefits likely marched further downward last week, a sign that companies are hesitant to lay off employees as the economy quickly recovers.<br />Jobless claims are at the lowest levels since the pandemic hit last spring. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the Labor Department to report that claims, a proxy for layoffs, declined to 370,000 last week from 385,000 a week earlier.<br />Claims remain well above weekly filings of just over 200,000 logged before the pandemic shut down large parts of the economy in March 2020. But they have steadily declined in recent weeks as rising Covid-19 vaccination rates and easing business restrictions spur economic activity.<br />“Employers have lots of jobs; they can’t find people, so they’re holding very tight to the workers they have,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.<br />Employers added 559,000 jobs in May, falling short of many economists’ predictions and reflecting businesses’ difficulties filling open jobs as potential workers remain on the sidelines."
