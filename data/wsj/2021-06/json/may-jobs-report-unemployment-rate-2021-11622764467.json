    "body": "Hiring in the U.S. is estimated to have accelerated in May, with signs of employers struggling to fill job openings as the economic recovery gained strength.<br />Economists expect the Labor Department to report Friday that employers added 671,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.9% last month. That would represent a significant improvement from April, when the unemployment rate was 6.1% and the economy added 266,000 jobs, a gain much smaller than economists had forecast.<br />The faster pace of hiring would come as several factors are propelling a burst of economic activity. More Americans have become vaccinated against the coronavirus, and state and local governments have eased restrictions on businesses as Covid-19 cases have declined and as the federal government has relaxed its pandemic guidance. Those factors, along with federal pandemic aid, have prompted a pickup in spending, particularly at services businesses, which in turn is stoking labor demand.<br />Employment in April was still down by about eight million jobs compared with pre-pandemic levels, and nearly 10 million people were unemployed and potentially available to work.<br />Economists predict that the labor market wonâ€™t fully recover until next year despite signs of robust demand for workers. The Federal Reserve, other policy makers and financial markets are closely watching the pace of hiring as a key indicator of strength in the overall recovery."
