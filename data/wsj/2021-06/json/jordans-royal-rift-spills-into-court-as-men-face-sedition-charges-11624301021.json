    "body": "A public rift between Jordan’s King Abdullah II and his younger half-brother entered a new stage, as two of the prince’s alleged co-conspirators appeared in court for the first time to face charges of sedition over their involvement in a purported plot to replace the monarch.<br />In a remarkable scene Monday at the state security court in Amman that was closed to the public, former royal court chief Bassem Awadallah and minor royal Sharif Hassan bin Zaid appeared handcuffed and wearing blue prison uniforms, according to their lawyers. Authorities say both were working on behalf of Prince Hamzah bin Hussein.<br />Mr. Awadallah, who developed ties to Saudi Arabia after leaving the Jordanian government over a decade ago, and Sharif Hassan face charges of sedition and incitement to oppose the political system, according to the indictment that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. They could face 20 years in prison if found guilty.<br />Both entered not guilty pleas, their lawyers said. Mr. Awadallah’s lawyer, Mohammad Afif, said that the trial had been adjourned until Tuesday and would likely take more than two months.<br />After a four-hour session in which the court heard from two witnesses, online video showed two black SUVs speeding away from the courthouse."
