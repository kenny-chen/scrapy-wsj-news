    "body": "Yields on Chinese junk bonds have jumped to levels last hit during the tail end of last year’s market turbulence, signaling growing investor concern about defaults.<br />Last week, the yield on an ICE BofA index of Chinese junk bonds in dollars topped 10% for the first time since May 2020. It closed Friday at 9.93%. In contrast, the equivalent index for global sub-investment grade debt ended the week at 4.57%. That was only 0.04 percentage point off a trough hit three days earlier, which was the lowest yield in a data set that goes back to 1997. Bond yields move inversely to prices.<br />The global benchmark is dominated by U.S. high-yield bonds, which have been buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s ultra-easy monetary policy and a robust economic recovery. Energy producers, a large slice of the U.S. market, have also benefited from a surge in commodity prices. As of Friday, the equivalent U.S. index yielded 4.65%.<br />The divergence means that Chinese junk bonds yield 5.36 percentage points over the global index. Apart from a brief period in March 2020, this spread, or gap, hasn’t been above that level since early 2012, ICE BofA data shows.<br />China’s policy makers, who once favored bailouts, have grown more tolerant of defaults in recent years. Authorities remain wary of market turbulence, but also want to restrain debt growth, and to dispel the idea that investors will always be made whole."
