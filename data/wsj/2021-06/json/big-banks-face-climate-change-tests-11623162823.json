    "body": "The Bank of England launched a program to assess the ability of lenders and insurers to withstand risks such as rising sea levels, flooding, cyclones and wildfires, in the latest step by a central bank to scrutinize the impact of climate change.<br />The U.K.’s biggest banks, including  HSBC Holdings  PLC and  Barclays  PLC, and insurers such as the U.K. units of  American International Group Inc.  and parts of Lloyd’s of London, will estimate how their businesses will perform in the next 30 years based on three different scenarios in which governments and companies either take early, late or no action to mitigate climate change.<br />The tests represent the latest step by central banks and financial regulators to look at climate change when assessing the health of financial institutions. Regulators have traditionally used similar “stress tests” to measure the resilience of lenders to adverse economic scenarios such as deep recessions, rises in interest rates or trade wars.<br />Many central bankers now see climate change as part of that mix, potentially leading to loan losses or higher inflation because of supply disruptions. Rising sea levels can endanger the value of an asset, such as a hotel, that is collateral for a loan. Floods caused by climate change can disrupt supply chains, leading to losses on loans and investments to corporations.<br />The Bank of England’s program will see lenders model the impact of climate change on loan losses and insurers, to assess how the value of assets and liabilities will change."
