    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Sometimes the title of a debut album tells you everything you need to know about a new band: MC5’s “Kick Out the Jams” introduced us to a Detroit outfit that played furiously intense rock, and “Straight Outta Compton” suggested that N.W.A. would serve up street-life reality rap from its home base in Los Angeles County. In 2001, a Norwegian duo released their first LP—an earlier self-titled record on a tiny label was more of a demo—whose title summarized their aesthetic perfectly: “Quiet Is the New Loud.” Alternative music in that year was dominated by nu metal acts like Linkin Park and Incubus, and the garage-rock wave led by groups like the Strokes and the White Stripes was right around the corner. Kings of Convenience, comprising Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe, who met in Bergen in the early 1990s, specialized in hushed folk-pop delivered with acoustic guitars and gentle harmonies. Their work was a challenge to themselves and also a dare for its audience: It was so soft and minimal you were tempted to let it disappear into the background completely, but the songs were so sharp and well-crafted that the music refused to."
