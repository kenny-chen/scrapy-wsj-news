    "body": "ALBANY, N.Y.—Investigators with the New York State attorney general’s office have interviewed a senior adviser to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and are examining the environment in the governor’s office going back more than a decade, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Investigators spoke recently with Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser who is one of the governor’s principal spokespeople, the people said. He is the highest-ranking current aide to Mr. Cuomo known to have been interviewed as part of the investigation into sexual-harassment allegations against the governor overseen by Attorney General Letitia James.<br />The attorney general and her spokespeople have declined to say when they plan to conclude the investigation. People familiar with the probe said they expected the governor’s senior aides, including Mr. Azzopardi, to be among the last questioned in the probe, which launched in March.<br />A spokeswoman for Ms. James declined to comment.<br />Ms. James’s investigators were initially charged with reviewing complaints from multiple women who said Mr. Cuomo sexually harassed or behaved inappropriately toward them. Mr. Cuomo has said he did nothing wrong and never touched anybody inappropriately. He has apologized if his behavior made anybody uncomfortable."
