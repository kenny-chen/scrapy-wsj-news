    "body": "True heroism manifests itself in many forms, and is so eloquently described in “One Last Mission: To Rescue a Fallen Marine’s Purple Heart” (Page One, May 29). Among the obvious heroes are Lance Corporal Walter O’Haire, who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving his country, and Ben Kesling, who tirelessly led the effort to recover the Marine’s missing medals and who wrote the inspiring story. But a person who stepped forward at a critical moment was the airline employee who initially refused to allow Mr. Kesling to board the plane with four carry-on items (as required by FAA and airline policy), but upon hearing his story simply responded, “You’re good.” Her grace and her instincts reflected true leadership when it might otherwise not have been expected.<br />We never know when we will have an opportunity to make a real difference at a key moment, and “You’re good” is a wonderful goal for which to strive.<br />Steve Zabilski<br />Phoenix<br />What an appropriate front page article for Memorial Day weekend. Kudos to the editors and reporter Ben Kesling for telling the moving story of the recovery and return of Lance Corporal Gator O’Haire’s Purple Heart and service medals to his family. It’s no surprise that Gen. Jim Mattis would write a letter; he always took care of his Marines. Bill Panagopulos, too, deserves credit for doing right by the memorabilia. Semper Fi."
