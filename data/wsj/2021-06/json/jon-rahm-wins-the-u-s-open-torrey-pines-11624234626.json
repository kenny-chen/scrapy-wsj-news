    "body": "SAN DIEGO—Jon Rahm finished his last tournament doubling over in anguish. He finished the U.S. Open screaming and pumping his fist in ecstasy.<br />The 26-year-old Spaniard emerged from a spectacularly crowded leaderboard to win his first major here at Torrey Pines Golf Course, capping a surreal rollercoaster that began two weeks ago. That’s when a viral clip showed him receiving the news that he had tested positive for Covid-19 as he walked off the course at the Memorial Tournament with a big lead and a clear path toward a $1.7 million payday. He had to withdraw and missed the payday.<br />Rahm made up for it here. The winner of the U.S. Open gets $2.3 million.<br />Rahm, the No. 3 ranked golfer in the world, took this U.S. Open at 6 under par, placing him one shot clear of South African Louis Oosthuizen. The win capped a frenetic Sunday that included a series of blow-ups, a fan running on the course and Spain’s first U.S. Open champion.<br />“I’m a big believer in karma,” Rahm said afterward."
