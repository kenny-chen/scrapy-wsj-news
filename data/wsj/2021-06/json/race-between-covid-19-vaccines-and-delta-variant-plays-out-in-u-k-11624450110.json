    "body": "LONDON—The highly transmissible Covid-19 Delta variant is generating rapidly rising caseloads in the U.K., but smaller increases in hospitalizations and fatalities, in a hopeful sign that mass vaccination can prevent a repeat of the heavy toll of sickness and death seen earlier in the pandemic.<br />The other message is one of caution. Epidemiologists say the U.K.’s experience shows how easily the variant can spread even within populations where vaccine uptake is high. That underscores the risk of further outbreaks of Covid-19 in the U.S. and other advanced economies, as well as the urgency of widening and accelerating vaccination programs.<br />“The Delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the U.S. to our attempt to eliminate Covid-19,” Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, said Tuesday.<br />Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, was first identified in the U.K. in March and has since spread to become the dominant version of the coronavirus in the country, with more than 75,000 cases confirmed by genetic analysis. A planned lifting of all remaining public-health restrictions this week was postponed until mid-July in response to the variant’s surge.<br />British scientists estimate the variant is 40% to 80% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, the dominant variant in multiple countries, which is itself more transmissible than the original virus that emerged from China in late 2019."
