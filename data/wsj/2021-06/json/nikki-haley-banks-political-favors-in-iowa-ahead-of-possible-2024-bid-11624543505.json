    "body": "DES MOINES, Iowa—Nikki Haley has sought in recent remarks to emphasize her own political identity while still appealing to former President Donald Trump’s deeply loyal supporters as she lays the groundwork for a possible 2024 presidential bid.<br />A critic of Mr. Trump before becoming his United Nations ambassador for two years, Ms. Haley will on Thursday evening headline the Republican Party of Iowa’s biggest gathering of the year.<br />Her Lincoln Dinner appearance, a high-profile stop in the state that is expected to host the first GOP presidential nomination balloting in 2024, will give the former South Carolina governor a chance to both introduce herself to activists and offer contrition to supporters of Mr. Trump that she may have offended in the past.<br />Earlier this year, Ms. Haley told Republican National Committee members that Mr. Trump would be “judged harshly by history” for his behavior after November’s election. She also told Politico she didn’t think the former president was going to be “in the picture” when it came to the party’s future because he had “fallen so far.”<br />Ms. Haley has since softened her tone, telling reporters in April that she won’t embark on a 2024 White House bid if Mr. Trump decides to run again himself. Her back and forth regarding the former president has left some questioning Ms. Haley’s political compass."
