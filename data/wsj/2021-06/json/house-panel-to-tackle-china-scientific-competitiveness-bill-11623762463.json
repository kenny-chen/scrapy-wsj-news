    "body": "WASHINGTON—A House committee on Tuesday will begin fine-tuning the chamber’s version of legislation aimed at boosting U.S. scientific competitiveness to keep pace with China, with the added aim of solving more social problems.<br />Similar legislation passed the Senate last week with significant bipartisan support, giving the effort considerable momentum. The House committee is likely to pass its version of the bill on Tuesday.<br />The legislative effort—with strong support from the Biden administration—is being touted by policy makers in Washington as a response to the competitive threat posed by China’s rapid advancements in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence.<br />But emerging differences in the Senate and House approaches are likely to complicate the debate.<br />Leaders of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, which will begin to consider amendments Tuesday to the proposed legislation, view their version as a way to substantially increase U.S. government spending on scientific research of many types, not just cutting-edge areas like artificial intelligence and quantum computing."
