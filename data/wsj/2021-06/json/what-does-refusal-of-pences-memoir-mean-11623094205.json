    "body": "I will never understand how a group of citizens can maintain their right to their beliefs, opinions and morals, and at the same time feel justified in taking those same rights from others (“Inside the Blowup Over Pence Memoir,” Page One, May 22). If a group wants to have its freedom of speech, how can that same freedom be taken from others? Whether in agreement or not with the publication of Vice President Mike Pence’s memoir, it cannot be acceptable that a group of individuals should have the ability to stop such a publication. It should be the decision of the public as to whether to purchase, read, agree or disagree with a publication. I don’t need others making that decision for me, and I have no right to make that decision for others.<br />Vanessa Strawder<br />Mooresville, Ind.<br /><br />The petition against the Pence book has more than 5,000 signatures. Are we willing to allow the voices of 5,000 out of a population of about 330 million silence a message many want to hear?"
