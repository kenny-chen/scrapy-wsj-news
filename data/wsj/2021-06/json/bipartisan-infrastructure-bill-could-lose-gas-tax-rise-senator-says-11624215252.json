    "body": "WASHINGTON—A proposed infrastructure spending plan may be hammered out without a measure raising the gasoline tax, a key Republican lawmaker said Sunday, suggesting the removal of an obstacle to a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure plan pushed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers.<br />Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), one of the lead Republicans in the group, said a higher gasoline tax may not be in the final package, citing opposition from the Biden administration.<br />“But the administration, therefore, will need to come forward with some other ideas without raising taxes,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday.<br />Eleven Republican Senators and 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus have said they support a proposed plan to spend $973 billion on infrastructure over five years, and President Biden was expected to review the plan this weekend.<br />According to a draft version of the plan, $579 billion of the money would represent new funding above expected baseline levels. Continued over eight years, the plan would dedicate $1.2 trillion to roads and bridges, broadband and water projects, among other forms of infrastructure."
