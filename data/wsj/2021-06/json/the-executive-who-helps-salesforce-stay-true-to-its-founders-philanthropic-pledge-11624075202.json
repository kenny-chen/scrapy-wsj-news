    "body": "Ebony Beckwith occupies a powerful perch as chief philanthropy officer of  Salesforce . com Inc. and head of its nonprofit foundation.<br />The highest Black executive at the business-software giant leads a global operation that disbursed more than $65 million in charitable grants during the year ended Jan. 31. She reports to Chief Executive Marc Benioff, a rare setup among corporate philanthropy officers.<br />Yet Ms. Beckwith feared she might get fired soon after joining the San Francisco-based company’s information technology department in 2008. Her supervisor, Kirsten Wolberg, criticized her for failing to finish projects and not requesting help.<br />“I thought I should know better,” the 44-year-old Ms. Beckwith explains. “Sometimes, that led to analysis paralysis.” The reformed perfectionist now knows she can perform better by seeking assistance—especially from mentors like Ms. Wolberg.<br />The pandemic altered Ms. Beckwith’s approach to assisting the less fortunate by going beyond Salesforce’s focus on education and workforce development."
