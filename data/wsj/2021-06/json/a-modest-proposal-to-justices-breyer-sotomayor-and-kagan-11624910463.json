    "body": "The three liberal justices argue that California’s rule requiring farmers to allow union organizers onto their property three hours a day for 120 days a year is merely “access regulation,” not a physical taking (“Big Win for Property Rights,” Review & Outlook, June 24). I’d like to take them up on their implicit offer.<br />As these justices likely have nicer dens than I do, I’ll come over one night (I’ll even bring the beer and munchies) and merely access, not take, their living quarters for a few hours. As they probably have bigger TVs than I do, also schedule me for football-season access. Next, I’ll need a temporary easement to their restrooms (see: beer, supra).<br />I’ll bring a copy of their dissent if I need to explain or defend myself.<br />Greg Debski<br />Howell, N.J."
