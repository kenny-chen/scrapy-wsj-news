    "body": "German company  CureVac  NV released the final results for its once-promising Covid-19 vaccine, finding it provided less protection than the vaccines already authorized for use in the U.S.<br />The company said Wednesday that its vaccine was 48% effective in providing protection against Covid-19 of any severity, regardless of age, in a large, pivotal study.<br />Shares in CureVac fell nearly 9% in after-hours trading, with shares trading around $67.27 after closing at $73.48 earlier in the day.<br />The final results confirm the preliminary findings the company released earlier this month. The vaccine might not have performed well enough to win wide use.<br />CureVac Chief Executive Franz-Werner Haas said in a statement that the vaccine, in a pivotal study named Herald, faced variants that some shots approved earlier hadnâ€™t."
