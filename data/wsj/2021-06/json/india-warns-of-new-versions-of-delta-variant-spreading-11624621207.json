    "body": "NEW DELHI—India is warning about new versions of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus that are spreading around the country, containing a mutation that the original didn’t have.<br />Indian officials have dubbed new versions of the variant containing the mutation Delta Plus. Delta Plus—with the mutation causing concern designated K417N—has been detected in at least 11 countries, including the U.S., U.K. and Japan, according to government health agency Public Health England.<br />Indian officials have been closely monitoring the Delta variant, which fueled the country’s ferocious Covid-19 surge in April and May. India has detected about 50 cases of Delta Plus so far through genomic sequencing.<br />“There is no reason to think at this point it’s worse than Delta, but there is no reason to think it’s an innocuous variant,” said Dr. Anurag Agrawal, director of the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, which operates one of the labs tasked with genomic sequencing of Covid-19 in India.<br />Scientists say there is no evidence that Delta Plus is significantly more transmissible or deadlier than the original variant. However, studies done on other variants containing the mutation indicate it might help the virus sidestep some of the body’s immune response. Lab research also indicates that the mutation might diminish the effectiveness of some monoclonal antibody treatments."
