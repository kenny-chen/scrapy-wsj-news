    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York liberal, and Sen. Joe Manchin, the pivotal West Virginia centrist, have long been a prominent odd couple on Capitol Hill.<br />But there are limits to what friendship can achieve in a Senate where each party has 50 seats and Vice President Kamala Harris has a tiebreaking vote.<br />It is Mr. Schumer’s job, as the Democratic leader, to keep the caucus united in the face of the pressure being piled on it from others in the Democratic Party, as he seeks to advance the Biden agenda, including trillions of dollars in infrastructure, education and child-care spending.<br />One obstacle to that unity is Mr. Manchin, a rare Democrat from a state that went heavily in the last two elections for former President Donald Trump and whose iconoclastic positioning on several Democratic priorities has drawn the ire of more progressive colleagues in Congress and party activists.<br />The interplay between the two men was on display when Mr. Schumer scheduled a vote to open debate on the Democrats’ sweeping elections bill. The bill itself was almost certain to fail, given it would require 60 votes—at least 10 from Republicans—to pass, and no Republican had signaled support. But Mr. Schumer wanted to proceed anyway to show that Democrats were united behind it and that its failure would be at Republican hands."
