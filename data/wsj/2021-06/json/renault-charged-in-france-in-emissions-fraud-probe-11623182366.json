    "body": "French prosecutors on Tuesday brought preliminary charges against  Renault SA  on suspicion of emissions fraud, adding to the fallout for auto makers following  Volkswagen AG’s  emission scandal.<br />The French auto maker said Tuesday it would need to pay a bail of 20 million euros, equivalent to $24.4 million, and provide bank guarantees of 60 million euros to compensate potential damages as part of the probe related to older diesel vehicles.<br />Renault denied wrongdoing and said its “vehicles have all and always been type-approved in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.”<br />It added that its vehicles aren’t equipped with rigging software for pollution-control devices.<br />French prosecutors opened an investigation into Renault in 2017 to probe whether the auto maker engaged in fraudulent practices that made its diesel-powered vehicles “dangerous to human and animal health.”"
