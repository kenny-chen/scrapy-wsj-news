    "body": "The Milwaukee Bucks will hold their breath. Atlanta Hawks fans will lose their minds. Everybody in the arena will stop what they’re doing to watch a magnificent basketball player do nothing.<br />This is what happens when Giannis Antetokounmpo steps to the free-throw line. He makes the most boring play in the NBA exhilarating.<br />It’s also one of the plays that will determine the rest of the playoffs. Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets are gone, and so are both No. 1 seeds. LeBron James and Stephen Curry are watching from home. Nikola Jokic is riding horses in Serbia. And the next NBA title will be won by the Bucks, Hawks, Phoenix Suns or Los Angeles Clippers.<br />It sounds improbable. But here are the shots that make those four teams possible champions.<br />A free throw is usually a good excuse to check your phone. Antetokounmpo stepping to the foul line is must-see television. He takes a deep breath, spins the ball, bounces it six times, stares at the basket, contemplates the meaning of life and then lets it fly."
