    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden signed legislation creating a national memorial at the site of a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., where 49 people were killed and dozens more injured by a gunman in 2016.<br />The somber moment came as the White House on Friday celebrated Pride Month and advancements of rights for LGBT people.<br />“Just over five years ago, Pulse nightclub, a place of acceptance and joy, became a place of unspeakable pain and loss,” Mr. Biden said in creating the National Pulse Memorial. “We’ll never fully recover, but we’ll remember.”<br />He was joined by survivors of the attack as well as LGBT advocates and lawmakers who steered the legislation to passage earlier this month. The signing event came as Florida dealt with the collapse of a condo tower in Surfside. At least four people are confirmed dead, and dozens more remain unaccounted for.<br />Mr. Biden compared the feeling of families in Surfside to those who had loved ones at the Pulse nightclub on the night of the shooting and were riven with uncertainty. “There’s nothing worse than having to wait and wonder what happened,” he said."
