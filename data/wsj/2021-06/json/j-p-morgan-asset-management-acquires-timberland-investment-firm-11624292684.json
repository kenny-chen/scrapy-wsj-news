    "body": "One of the biggest names on Wall Street is getting into the timber business, and a big part of its plan to make money involves less logging.<br />J.P. Morgan Asset Management said Monday that it has acquired Campbell Global LLC, a Portland, Ore., firm that manages $5.3 billion worth of timberland on behalf of institutional investors, such as pensions and insurance companies.<br />The deal gives the $2.5 trillion asset manager a position in the booming market for forest-carbon offsets, tradable assets that are created by paying landowners to not cut down trees and leave them standing to sponge carbon from the atmosphere. Offsets are used by companies to scrub emissions from their internal carbon ledgers, which track progress toward pollution-reduction goals.<br />Terms of the deal with Campbell’s seller,  BrightSphere Investment Group Inc.,  weren’t disclosed.<br />Many of the world’s largest companies, including  Apple  Inc.,   Microsoft  Corp.  and  Royal Dutch Shell  PLC, have promised investors they will reduce their carbon footprints. Many emissions are unavoidable for global businesses, which has made standing timber a hot commodity."
