    "body": "OTTAWA—Canadian prosecutors said Monday they would pursue terrorism-related charges against a 20-year-old man who police allege used a pickup truck to plow down a family, killing four members, because of their Muslim faith.<br />At a 10-minute hearing in the Ontario Court of Justice in London, Ontario, a federal prosecutor alleged the four first-degree murder charges and one count of attempted murder filed against Nathaniel Veltman also constitute offenses under Canada’s terrorism laws.<br />Canadian law defines terrorism as an act “committed in whole or in part for a political, religious or ideological purpose, objective or cause,” with the intention of intimidating the public.<br />Mr. Veltman appeared in court via videolink, in which prosecutors informed him of the terrorism charges. He didn’t address the new charges against him, and his next court date is set for June 21. Mr. Veltman told the judge he has yet to retain a lawyer. He hasn’t addressed the first-degree-murder and attempted-murder charges that he faces.<br />Evidence submitted at hearings related to Mr. Veltman’s charges is subject to a publication ban."
