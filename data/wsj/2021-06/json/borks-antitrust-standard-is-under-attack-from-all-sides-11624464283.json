    "body": "In “Unfortunately, ‘Big Is Bad’ Is Back” (Inside View, June 7), Andy Kessler notes that the consumer-welfare standard, which has governed American antitrust law for almost half a century, is in peril.<br />Under this doctrine first put forward by my father, Judge Robert Bork, the government and courts are no longer consumed with questions of “bigness” and “worthy men,” attempting to divine what the future of the economy should look like. Instead, as the intervening decades have proved, the consumer-welfare standard’s principles work to protect consumers while allowing business the freedom and flexibility to innovate.<br />I am not as sanguine as Mr. Kessler that radical antitrust legislation cannot pass Congress. For the first time, a bipartisan coalition aims to destroy the core of American antitrust law. In their anger against the content decisions of Big Tech, Republicans led by Sen. Josh Hawley would willingly grant the Biden Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission authority as superregulators of the U.S. economy. In aiming at Big Tech, they would subject all of American capitalism to top-down control. It is time for conservatives to remember our principles and track record.<br />Robert H. Bork Jr.<br />Antitrust Education Project"
