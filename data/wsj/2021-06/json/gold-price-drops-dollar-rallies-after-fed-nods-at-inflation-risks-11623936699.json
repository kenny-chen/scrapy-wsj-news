    "body": "Gold dropped sharply and the dollar rose Thursday after the Federal Reserve signaled it may raise interest rates sooner than expected.<br />Gold futures declined 4.5%, the largest drop in over 10 months. That took gold down to $1,777.80 a troy ounce, its lowest since early May.<br /><br />The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, advanced 0.3%. That added to its 0.8% gain on Wednesday, which was its biggest one-day gain since March 2020. Against the euro, the dollar rose another 0.5% Thursday, putting at about $1.19 per euro.<br />Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Wednesday said the higher inflation recorded this year should be temporary, but the risks that it would persist couldn’t be ignored. Some members of the rate-setting committee brought forward their expectations of when rates might have to rise."
