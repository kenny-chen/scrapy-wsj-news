    "body": "The prices that businesses are charging their customers likely rose again last month, adding to inflation pressures bubbling through the economy.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the Labor Department to report Tuesday that its so-called producer-price index rose 0.5% in May from the prior month, down slightly from the 0.6% increase in April from March. The average rise between 2017 and 2019 was 0.2%.<br />The PPI is different from the departmentâ€™s more widely followed consumer-price index, which only measures the final prices paid directly by households for goods and services: The PPI also includes prices paid by companies, governments, third-party payers like insurers and buyers in other countries. The CPI, unlike the PPI, includes taxes and user charges and the prices of imported goods and services, because they are part of the total costs paid by consumers.<br />The PPI captures various changes in prices as products move through the economy, said Scott Sager, supervisor economist with the PPI division at the Labor Department. For example, the price that a manufacturer charges a wholesaler for a washing machine shows up in PPI. The CPI captures what the consumer paid the retailer for the appliance, including taxes.<br />The two measures often diverge. But with consumer prices rising at the fastest pace in 13 years, economists are watching the PPI for clues about the sources of inflationary pressures driving consumer prices."
