    "body": "San Diego<br />The best golfer in the world who had yet to win a major knew he had the perfect excuse if he fell short at the U.S. Open.<br />“Hey,” Jon Rahm convinced himself. “I had Covid.”<br />Over the course of 15 days, Rahm rode a pandemic roller coaster unlike anything else in sports since the onset of the pandemic. He received the results of a positive Covid-19 test on national television when he was on the verge of winning another tournament. Instead of collecting a $1.7 million prize, he quarantined. And this weekend he emerged in the most dramatic way possible: Rahm actually won the U.S. Open.<br />Rahm, the No. 3 ranked golfer entering the tournament, prevailed for his first major with a 6-under-par performance at Torrey Pines. The 26-year-old Spaniard became his country’s first player to win the U.S. Open by sinking back-to-back birdie putts on the 17th and 18 holes, electrifying galleries and eliciting roars that carried across the grounds."
