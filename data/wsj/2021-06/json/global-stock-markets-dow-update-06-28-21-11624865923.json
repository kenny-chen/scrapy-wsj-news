    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered Monday, suggesting major indexes will hover close to record highs after the S&P 500 posted its biggest weekly advance since February.<br />Futures for the broad market gauge, which closed Friday at its 31st all-time high of the year, drifted between muted gains and losses. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.2% lower. Futures for the Nasdaq-100 ticked up 0.2%, pointing to modest gains for technology stocks.<br />Shares have marched higher since mid May, boosted by a robust economic recovery, the prospect of further fiscal stimulus and low bond yields that prompted investors to snap up stocks. Some investors are nonetheless concerned the market could hit a rough patch amid signs that growth has peaked as well as jitters over the outlook for inflation and monetary policy.<br />“This recovery still has a long way to go and there is still strong growth,” said Frank Øland, chief strategist at Danske Bank. “But of course you’re probably past the peak growth momentum in the U.S., so data will begin to look less impressive, and that could be a concern.”<br />Danske has dialed down its holdings of U.S. stocks and bought more shares in Europe, where Mr. Øland said the economic recovery is still accelerating."
