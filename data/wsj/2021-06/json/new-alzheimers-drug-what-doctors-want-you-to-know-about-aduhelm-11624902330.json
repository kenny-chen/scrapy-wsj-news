    "body": "After the FDA approved a controversial new Alzheimer’s drug earlier this month, doctors are fielding lots of questions about it from patients and their caregivers.<br />The drug, called Aduhelm, removes amyloid, a sticky substance in the brain that is a defining feature of Alzheimer’s disease. But some doctors say it’s unclear whether removing amyloid will actually slow the progression of the disease. Clinical trials yielded mixed results.<br />Alzheimer’s, a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and cognitive skills, is the most common cause of dementia. Its biological hallmark is sticky protein clusters—called amyloid plaques—in the brain, as well as tangles of fibers, composed of tau protein.<br />We asked doctors what patients need to know about the new drug—and what questions they should be asking their doctors.<br />Aduhelm, made by  Biogen ,  is a monthly infusion that can be done at an infusion center or a doctor’s office. It’s unclear how long patients would need to take it; the clinical trials ended after a year."
