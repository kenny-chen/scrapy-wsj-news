    "body": "A week before Lorraine Twohill applied to engineering school in her native Ireland, she found herself reviewing a brochure about a new degree called international marketing. Its promise of a year studying abroad led the math whiz to swap engineering for marketing.<br />The last-minute shift three decades ago broke the heart of her father, a math teacher, but changed her life. Her studies at Dublin City University and year abroad in Spain put her on a path to become the chief marketing officer at Google, a role she has held long enough to watch the plucky search company transform into a tech giant with an ad budget of more than $5 billion.<br />“I started that course and never looked back,” Ms. Twohill said.<br />A few years after graduating, Ms. Twohill landed at a dot-com era travel company, Opodo, where she bought early digital ads on Google—then a search engine startup. When Google invited her to visit its office, she arrived expecting to discuss Opodo’s account. Instead she found herself in a series of interviews that resulted in a job offer that she nearly rejected.<br />“I had a great job and another offer that looked like a much bigger job,” she said of the 2003 opportunity. “But I saw firsthand the genius that was AdWords.”"
