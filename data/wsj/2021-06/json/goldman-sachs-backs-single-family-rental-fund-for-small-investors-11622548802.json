    "body": "A startup that wants to open up the single-family home rental market to small investors is ramping up its home purchases, after winning the backing of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.<br />Real-estate firm Fundrise manages a fund that enables customers to invest as little as $500 in homes going up in fast-growing cities such as Charlotte, N.C., Tampa, Fla., and San Antonio. With the dearth of homes for sale throughout the U.S. pushing up housing prices, single-family rentals have become an increasingly popular alternative to buying in desirable neighborhoods.<br />Goldman Sachs last week provided a $300 million credit facility to Fundrise, the startup said. The deal comes as more financial firms court individual investors. Apps such as Robinhood have turned thousands of younger and less wealthy people into busy stock traders, leading to hopes that some of them could be drawn to real estate, too.<br />Washington, D.C.-based Fundrise manages a so-called interval fund, in which individual investors can invest small sums without going through a broker, though they can only pull out their money at set intervals.<br />The fund has raised around $200 million since its January launch, and has bought or signed contracts to buy around 2,500 homes, said Fundrise Chief Executive Ben Miller."
