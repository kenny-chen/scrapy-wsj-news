    "body": "Blackstone Group Inc.  has agreed to buy a company that buys and rents single-family homes in a $6 billion deal thatâ€™s a sign Wall Street believes the U.S. housing market is going to stay hot.<br />The giant investment firm has reached a deal to acquire Home Partners of America Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. Home Partners owns more than 17,000 houses throughout the U.S., which it bought, rents out and offers its tenants the chance to eventually buy.<br />U.S. home sales soared last year at their fastest pace in 14 years, when low mortgage rates and the rise of remote work during the pandemic sent buyers scrambling to find larger living spaces.<br />The lack of homes for sale relative to demand and record housing prices have slowed the pace of home sales in recent months. But on a historic basis, the market remains red hot, and analysts say that demand from millennials entering their prime homebuying years is expected to fuel demand for years to come.<br />Blackstone was among the big investment firms to buy houses in bulk in the aftermath of the subprime crisis, when lenders sold off foreclosed homes at marked-down prices. The New York firm built a portfolio of tens of thousands of single-family homes, then rented them out through a company called  Invitation Homes Inc."
