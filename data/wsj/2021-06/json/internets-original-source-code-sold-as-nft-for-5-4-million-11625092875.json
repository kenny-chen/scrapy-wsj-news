Mr. Berners-Lee’s sale ranks among the most valuable NFTs of digital artworks ever sold, according to Sotheby’s.<br />NFTs are a kind of digital asset that work on the blockchain, similar to cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, and are unique tokens, each with their own identification that can’t be replicated. They can act as a digital certificate of authenticity for everything from works of art, sports collectibles to music albums."
