    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration said it is expanding a program designed to let children and teenagers from Central America come to the U.S. legally, as the government continues to grapple with large numbers of migrant children crossing the southern border illegally.<br />The expansion, part of the administration’s effort to find more pathways for Central Americans to migrate legally, could make tens of thousands of children newly eligible to participate in the program, said State Department deputy spokeswoman Jalina Porter. That would allow them to board flights to the U.S. with government permission.<br />The Central American Minors program, started by the Obama administration in 2014, applies to people under the age of 21 coming from the so-called Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, which over the past decade have sent a majority of asylum-seeking migrants to the U.S.-Mexico border.<br />The Obama administration created the program in response to the first wave of unaccompanied minors crossing the border illegally, to offer them a safer alternative to reach the U.S.<br />Former President Donald Trump terminated the program in 2017, saying it was an immigration pathway that had been created without congressional approval. President Biden restarted it March 10."
