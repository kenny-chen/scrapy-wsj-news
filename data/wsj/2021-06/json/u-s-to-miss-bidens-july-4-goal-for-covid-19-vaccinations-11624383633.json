    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House said the U.S. will fall short of President Biden’s goal for 70% of the adult population to receive at least one coronavirus vaccine dose by July 4.<br />Mr. Biden had set the goal in early May, with an aim for a return to normalcy to mark the Independence Day holiday. White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeffrey Zients said Tuesday the target had been met for those age 30 and over but not for the overall eligible population.<br />Mr. Zients said it would take a few extra weeks to reach the president’s target and cited a reluctance to get the vaccine among people between the ages of 18 and 26 as one of the challenges facing the country.<br />“The reality is many younger Americans have felt like Covid-19 is not something that impacts them and they have been less eager to get the shot,” Mr. Zients said.<br />He pointed to an overall decline in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths to emphasize the nation’s progress in fighting the pandemic. Mr. Zients said the White House plans to celebrate the July 4 holiday with a gathering of 1,000 people on the South Lawn, and he expressed confidence that 70% of people age 27 and older will have received at least a first dose by July 4."
