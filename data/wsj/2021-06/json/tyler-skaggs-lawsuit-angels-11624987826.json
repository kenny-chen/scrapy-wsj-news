    "body": "The family of Tyler Skaggs, the Los Angeles Angels pitcher who died of a drug overdose in 2019, has filed two lawsuits against the team, the owner’s business and two former employees alleging wrongful death due to negligence and negligent hiring and supervision.<br />The nearly identical lawsuits, filed in county courts in California and Texas, accuses the team and ex-employees of behaving in a way that led to Skaggs’s overdose on fentanyl, placing a renewed spotlight on the MLB team’s role in the death of one its own players.<br />The suits allege that  the Angels should have known an employee, Eric Kay, was providing drugs to Skaggs and five other players, and that the team’s inaction contributed to Skaggs’ death.<br />Kay, the team’s former communications director and one of the defendants, had previously been charged in federal court with providing Skaggs with the drugs that caused his death. The other named ex-employee, Tim Mead, was a longtime Angels executive who had taken a job as the president of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum before stepping down in April.<br />In a statement, the Angels said the independent investigation they commissioned determined the team did know Skaggs was using opioids while nobody “in management” was aware of any employee providing opioids to any player."
