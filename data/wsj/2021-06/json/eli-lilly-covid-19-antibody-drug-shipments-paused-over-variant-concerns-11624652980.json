    "body": "U.S. health officials have paused the distribution of two  Eli Lilly  & Co. Covid-19 monoclonal antibody treatments because of data showing that they aren’t effective against virus variants that are becoming increasingly common across the country.<br />The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that it is immediately pausing all distribution of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, as well as etesevimab alone to be paired with existing supplies of bamlanivimab, in the U.S. until further notice.<br />Health administrators cited analyses that found that the two antibody treatments together weren’t effective against two variants: the Gamma variant, first identified in Brazil, and the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa.<br />These variants account for more than 11% of Covid-19 cases, a share that is growing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />Distribution of the antibody treatments was already paused because of concerns regarding their effectiveness with the variants in at least nine states including Rhode Island, Arizona, California, Florida, Washington and Massachusetts."
