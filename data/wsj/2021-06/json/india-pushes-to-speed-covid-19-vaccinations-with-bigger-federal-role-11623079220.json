    "body": "NEW DELHI—Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India’s federal government would take a greater role in procuring vaccines, in an effort to accelerate vaccinations in a country hit hard by a recent Covid-19 surge.<br />India was supposed to be a global vaccine manufacturing powerhouse that would supply doses to much of the world and its more than 1.3 billion people, but it has struggled on both fronts.<br />In its latest attempt to boost its domestic campaign, Mr. Modi said on Monday that the government would take over buying most vaccines after previously allowing state governments and private hospitals to procure them for those ages 18 to 44. Many states had struggled to secure sufficient supplies. Some foreign vaccine makers preferred to work with federal authorities, people familiar with the matter said.<br />India has accelerated its domestic campaign in recent days, administering about three million doses a day last week, up from about one million a day in late May. But the country is still well short of the pace it would need to reach its ambitious goal of vaccinating all adults by the end of the year. For that, the country would need to be administering an estimated eight million doses a day, said Bhramar Mukherjee, professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan.<br />Meanwhile, vaccine exports, which were halted in March to give priority to the domestic effort, aren’t likely to resume until October at the earliest, according to people familiar with the matter."
