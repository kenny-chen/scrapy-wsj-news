That gap on your résumé might not be the obstacle you think it is.<br />The stigma around career pauses, already beginning to ebb in recent years, has eased further amid Covid, according to recruiters, job seekers and human resources executives. The past year has left hiring managers with a new awareness of all the ways a career can suddenly go sideways: child-care pressures, layoffs from battered industries, illness. A survey by jobs site Monster last fall found that 49% of 400 U.S. recruiters believed résumé gaps had shifted from being a red flag to acceptable.<br />Now the job market is heating up and companies need talent. Employers are willing to forgive periods of unemployment stretching back about two years, says Darrell James, an executive recruiter based in Sugar Land, Texas, who’s counseled those laid off from the oil and gas industry. Even if you stopped working before March 2020, there’s an understanding that your break likely stretched on because many companies held off on hiring for much of last year.<br />“They’re not holding that against you,” he says.<br />Will employers’ patience and openness run out at some point? And how much should you share about your pandemic break, especially if it’s related to family responsibilities?"
