    "body": "I am a former member of Kimberley Strassel’s “faceless, nameless bureaucracy,” and she is right about the “liberal monopoly over federal agencies.” However, she fails to tell us why this is so, why “‘federal government employee’ is increasingly interchangeable with ‘registered Democrat’” (“The Partisan Bureaucracy,“ Potomac Watch, June 11). It has little to do with the list of bureaucrats leaking news stories. That’s as far removed from an explanation as my reason for once leaning left: I did not enjoy having lunch alone in Washington.<br />The fault, dear Brutus, lies with us, the political right, our “party of no.” During my 26 bureaucratic years, a Republican usually thought of an appointment as a couple of years in punching a ticket to be used later going up the corporate ladder, whereas whenever a Democrat was appointed to fill a key post, a fire was lit in the agency and the careerists were more than happy to stroke the flames. Maybe that’s why Democrats are referred to as the “party of government.”<br />Think of it this way: Would you rather work for an organization that believes in growth or one that believes in going out of business? I thought so.<br />David Reynolds<br />Lexington, Va."
