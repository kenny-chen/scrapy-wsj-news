    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democratic state Rep. Melanie Stansbury won a closely watched U.S. House special election in New Mexico on Tuesday night, according to the Associated Press, keeping the seat under Democratic control and expanding the party’s narrow majority.<br />Ms. Stansbury defeated GOP state Sen. Mark Moores to replace former Democratic Rep. Deb Haaland in the Albuquerque-based district. Ms. Haaland was confirmed as President Biden’s interior secretary in mid-March, becoming the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary.<br />Ms. Stansbury, a water-resources expert, previously worked on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and served in the Office of Management and Budget under President Barack Obama. Mr. Moores, a former University of New Mexico football player, owns a healthcare business with his wife.<br />The Democrats’ victory Tuesday night gives House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) slightly more room to maneuver in any legislative battles. Once Ms. Stansbury is sworn in, Democrats will be able to lose four votes from their own ranks on legislation opposed by all Republicans.<br />Politicians and analysts were eager to mine the results for any early indications of the political climate under Mr. Biden as both parties begin to rev up for next year’s midterm elections."
