    "body": "Shoppers likely pulled back on auto purchases last month while boosting spending on other items and at restaurants, as more people got vaccinated against Covid-19 and business restrictions were further eased.<br />Economists estimate that Tuesday’s Commerce Department report will show that overall retail sales declined 0.6% in May. They expect that sales excluding autos rose a solid 0.5% from a month earlier.<br />Consumers are venturing out as the pandemic fades, spending more at stores and on services that were either shut down or operating with restrictions throughout the pandemic. Economists expect consumer spending to continue powering the economic recovery this year.<br />“This spending celebration has a number of months to run,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings. Households “have a lot of money to spend,” she said, referencing the mounds of savings that some consumers accumulated during lockdowns and multiple rounds of government stimulus.<br />Stronger overall spending is helping propel the broader U.S. economy, which grew at a 6.4% annual rate in the first quarter. Economists project that by the end of this year gross domestic product will reach the path it was projected to follow had the pandemic never happened—and then exceed it, at least temporarily."
