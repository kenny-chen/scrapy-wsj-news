It has a number of high-profile investors including  Alphabet Inc.  and  SoftBank Group Corp.’s  Vision Fund.<br />This deal and a planned IPO by ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing Technology Co. show Chinese startups are still pursuing U.S. listings, even as the Biden administration has maintained some of former President Donald Trump’s tough stance on businesses from China.<br />The indicative price range for the share sales implies a market value for Full Truck Alliance of about $18.5 billion to $20.6 billion, whose stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange.<br />Alongside the IPO, the company is raising another $200 million by privately selling $100 million of stock each to two big investors, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and a unit of Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund."
