    "body": "Saudi Aramco’s return to the global debt markets this week demonstrated the oil giant’s need to raise cash despite high energy prices, as it issued its inaugural dollar-denominated Islamic bond to meet a dividend pledge and complete a costly acquisition.<br />Saudi Arabian Oil Co., as the world’s largest listed oil company is officially called, raised $6 billion in Islamic bonds, or sukuk, on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the issue. It last sold $8 billion in conventional bonds in November when oil prices were floundering due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />An Aramco spokesperson said the company was raising funds for general corporate purposes.<br />Oil prices have rebounded in recent months, easing some pressure on Aramco, but it would still need to borrow to meet its commitments, analysts said.<br />Aramco pledged to pay an annual $75 billion dividend in a bid to lure investors to an initial public offering in 2019. It also agreed to pay $69 billion for a majority stake in Saudi Arabia’s national petrochemicals firm in a deal encouraged by the Saudi government, which owns 98% of Aramco and relies on the dividends for much of its funding."
