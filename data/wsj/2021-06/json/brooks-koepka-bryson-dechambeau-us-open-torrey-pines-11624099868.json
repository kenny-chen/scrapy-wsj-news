    "body": "SAN DIEGO—Bryson DeChambeau has a habit of muttering to himself. “Two days in a row I’ve missed it far left,” he said to no one in particular after bogeying the par-3 third hole Friday. “That’s unbelievable.”<br />This same quirk is also what has invigorated the feud that’s dominating golf and attracting more crowd attention than anything else at this U.S. Open. It’s Brooks vs. Bryson.<br />It hasn’t been a secret that Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka don’t particularly like one another, and that was before a leaked video last month showed Koepka cursing about DeChambeau at the PGA Championship. And the tension between the pair—two of the best golfers in the world—has only escalated since.<br />Both are now in the hunt entering the weekend here at Torrey Pines. Both are at even par through two rounds, placing them five strokes behind the co-leaders Richard Bland and Russell Henley. Both are more than capable of erasing a deficit of that size in just 18 holes.<br />DeChambeau is the reigning U.S. Open champion. Koepka is a four-time major winner. And the crowded galleries following the two in their respective groups reflected the drama that has gripped the sport."
