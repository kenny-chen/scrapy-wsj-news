    "body": "WASHINGTON—House lawmakers have drafted legislation designed to curb the market power of large online platforms by restricting them from certain lines of business and curtailing their ability to buy competitors, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The lawmakers are considering five draft bills, the documents show. They would make it unlawful for operators of large platforms to control a business that creates an irreconcilable conflict of interest, to advantage their own products or services over a competitor, and to acquire companies that pose current or potential competitive threats.<br />Another bill targets the budgets of antitrust enforcement agencies, while a fifth requires platforms to make their services interoperable with those of other companies.<br />The legislative ideas are being discussed as part of talks between Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.) and Rep. Ken Buck (R., Col.), the top two members of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Details of the drafts could change before the final bills are introduced, and it isn’t yet known whether the proposals will win broad support from both parties, these people said."
