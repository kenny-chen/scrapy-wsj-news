    "body": "Boeing Co.  has estimated the new Air Force One jets it is building may arrive a year late and cost taxpayers more than planned, a top Pentagon official said.<br />The aerospace giant has proposed handing over the two new presidential jets by the end of 2025, a year later than planned, acting Assistant Air Force Secretary Darlene Costello said on Tuesday during testimony before a House panel.<br />Boeing struck a $3.9 billion deal to replace the aging 747s, which are known as Air Force One when the commander-in-chief is on board, with then-President Donald Trump in 2018. Boeing is expected to seek more than $500 million in additional government funding for the two modified 747 jumbo jets because of an increase in costs related to the Covid-19 pandemic and a supplier’s bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />An Air Force spokesman said Boeing hasn’t formally requested additional funding. Ms. Costello said Boeing has told the Air Force it intended to submit such a request. Boeing declined to comment.<br />“This is a disappointment to all of us,” said Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee."
