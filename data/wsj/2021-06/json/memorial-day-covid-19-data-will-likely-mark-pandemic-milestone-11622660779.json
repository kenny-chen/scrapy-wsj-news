    "body": "Memorial Day will be the first major test of the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccinations in the U.S., according to many epidemiologists.<br />Last year, reopenings in parts of the U.S. ahead of the holiday weekend led to a second surge of new coronavirus cases. Hospitalizations climbed in late June, followed by a steady rise in fatalities after the first week of July.<br />This year, epidemiologists and public-health officials are hopeful that despite millions of Americans traveling for the weekend and the broad rollback of pandemic restrictions, newly reported Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths will remain low as more of the country continues to get vaccinated, albeit at lower rates.<br />“We have seen after holiday weekends in the past that cases have risen, but we’ve never been in a position where we’ve had almost half the adults of America vaccinated and protected from this virus,” said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky last week.<br />Dr. Walensky nevertheless warned the virus remained dangerous for the unvaccinated. She encouraged those who hadn’t gotten a Covid-19 shot to do so and in the meantime continue wearing masks and practicing physical distancing."
