    "body": "The debate over the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the new Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm (“The Attack on an Alzheimer’s Drug,” Review & Outlook, June 22) misses the larger point: It was never a good idea to make proof of efficacy part of the FDA drug-approval process.<br />The requirement, which dates to 1962, adds more than 10 years to the drug-approval process, a major factor causing high prices. The lag causes millions to suffer or even die waiting to try a drug that may already be available in other countries. Congress acknowledged this when it passed the Right to Try Act in 2018.<br />Ironically, once a drug is approved to treat one condition, the FDA places no restrictions on its use in any other setting. An estimated 20% of prescriptions are for such “off-label” use. The agency defers to the judgment of doctors, who base their decisions on their experience and analysis of continuing clinical research. So, after waiting years for the FDA to allow doctors to prescribe a drug for condition A, doctors are given free rein to prescribe it for conditions B to Z.<br />Medical journals are replete with clinical research on the efficacy of various drugs, which continues long after FDA approval. The brouhaha over Aduhelm assists those of us who contend the FDA should stick to its original mission of assuring a drug’s safety and leave decisions about its efficacy to the people who use it.<br />Jeffrey A. Singer, M.D."
