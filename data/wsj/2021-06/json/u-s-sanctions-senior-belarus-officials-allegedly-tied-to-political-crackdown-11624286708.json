    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. and its trans-Atlantic allies on Monday imposed financial sanctions against senior Belarus officials and police units the Biden administration said are responsible for escalating political repression, including the forced diversion of a commercial airline carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his subsequent arrest in May.<br />The sanctions mark a significant expansion of pressure by the Biden administration as it coordinates joint action with the European Union and other Western governments against the political crackdown by the former Soviet state’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko.<br />“We are united in our deep concern regarding the Lukashenko regime’s continuing attacks on human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law,” the U.S., the EU, the U.K. and Canada said in a joint statement accompanying the sanctions.<br />The statement cited the arrest last month of Mr. Protasevich and his companion after Mr. Lukashenko forced the  Ryanair  flight carrying them through Belarusian airspace to land in Minsk.<br />The Belarus Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Lukashenko and his officials have rejected Western government criticism and called their collective actions a campaign of hybrid warfare against his administration."
