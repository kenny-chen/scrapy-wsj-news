    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Danspace Project, in New York’s historic St. Mark’s Church in-the-Bowery, has been supporting a diverse range of choreographers for over 45 years. In 2010, Judy Hussie-Taylor, its executive director and chief curator, initiated Platforms, multiweek performances that Danspace calls “exhibitions that unfold over time.” The latest, “The Dream of the Audience,” features newly commissioned works by Ishmael Houston-Jones; Okwui Okpokwasili; Eiko Otake and Joan Jonas, who is well known as a video and performance artist; and Reggie Wilson. These choreographers, each a previous Platform participant, were chosen pre-pandemic by Ms. Hussie-Taylor, only to find themselves, due to the Covid-19 lockdown, later challenged by her “to respond to this precarious moment with distant audiences and empty spaces.”"
