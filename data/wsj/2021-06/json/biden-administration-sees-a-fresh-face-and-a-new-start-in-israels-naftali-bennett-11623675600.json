    "body": "It took only two hours for President Biden, in Europe on his first overseas trip, to call Naftali Bennett after he was sworn in Sunday as the new prime minister of Israel.<br />A White House readout of the call and an earlier statement sent minutes after Mr. Bennett took the oath of office made one thing clear: The Biden administration is looking to start off on the right foot with the new Israel government.<br />Absent from the White House’s communiqués was any mention of Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Biden’s longtime friend whose 12-year rule came to an end Sunday. In contrast to the quick outreach to Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden waited almost a month after taking office to call the embattled former prime minister.<br />Mr. Biden is looking to chart a course with Israel’s new government, which is taking control at a time of intense political strife in Israel and amid growing pressure on the U.S. president from progressive Democrats to challenge Israel over the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and what they see as discriminatory policies against Arab Israelis.<br />Mr. Biden’s four-decade friendship with Mr. Netanyahu was seen as key to his ability to help negotiate a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas last month, following 11 days of deadly fighting."
