    "body": "A New York judge ruled Tuesday that Harvey Weinstein can be extradited to Los Angeles, paving the way for the former Hollywood producer to face sex-crimes charges in California after more than a year of delays because of the pandemic and his health.<br />Mr. Weinstein could be turned over to California authorities as soon as the middle of next month. He is currently serving a 23-year sentence at a maximum-security prison near Buffalo, N.Y., where his attorney said he was undergoing medical treatment.<br />Mr. Weinstein challenged the extradition, arguing that Los Angeles prosecutors hadn’t properly completed the paperwork seeking his transfer and that he wouldn’t receive adequate medical care in a West Coast jail.<br />“Prisons are designed for long-term incarceration. Jails are not,” said an attorney for Mr. Weinstein on Tuesday, arguing that his client should remain in the New York facility until jury selection begins in the California case.<br />Prosecutors in New York’s Erie County, where Mr. Weinstein’s prison is located, handled arguments for why Mr. Weinstein should be extradited to Los Angeles. They said Mr. Weinstein was certainly entitled to medical treatment but shouldn’t be able to dictate where."
