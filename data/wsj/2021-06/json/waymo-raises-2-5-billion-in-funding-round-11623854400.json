    "body": "Waymo LLC said it raised $2.5 billion in its latest investment round as it seeks to continue developing its autonomous-driving technology for passenger cars and in freight hauling.<br />The funding for the self-driving affiliate of Google parent  Alphabet Inc.  comes amid a period of heightened interest and competition in the auto industry. Several electric-vehicle upstarts, inspired by  Tesla Inc.’s  surging valuation, have turned to the public markets for additional funding.<br />The company on Wednesday said it wants to use Waymo Driver technology to move people and goods. Its autonomous ride-hailing service, Waymo One, has had thousands of trips in metro Phoenix where some customers are shuttled around in minivans without a person behind the wheel, Waymo said. Waymo is conducting tests of its autonomous vehicle technology with riders in San Francisco.<br />For its Waymo Via delivery unit, the company said it has joined with  J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc.  to move freight across the country. Its clients on a local level include  United Parcel Service Inc.  and  AutoNation Inc.<br />Waymo said existing investors Alphabet, private-equity firm Silver Lake, venture-capital giant Andreessen Horowitz and car-dealership chain AutoNation Inc. participated in the funding round, along with Fidelity Management & Research Co. and others."
