    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in April after setting a record level in March as challenges with global supply chains contributed to a slowdown in imports to the U.S.<br />The deficit in trade of goods and services shrank by 8.2% to a seasonally adjusted $68.9 billion in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, compared with the record $75 billion gap in March.<br />Imports fell 1.4% to $273.9 billion, while exports grew 1.1% to $205 billion.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a trade deficit of $69 billion for April.<br />Global trade, which collapsed during the coronavirus pandemic, has been roaring back this year as economies increasingly reopen. A resurgent U.S. consumer, bolstered by rising rates of vaccination, dwindling restrictions on businesses and flush with multiple rounds of government stimulus checks have been driving demand for imports."
