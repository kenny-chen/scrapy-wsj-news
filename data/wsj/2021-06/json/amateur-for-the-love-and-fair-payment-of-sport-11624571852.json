Earlier this week, the Supreme Court threw up its hands at this thorny semantic question.<br />The National Collegiate Athletic Association bars compensating student athletes in the name of protecting “amateurism”—a “revered tradition,” according to a Supreme Court decision on the matter back in 1984. But this week, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court found “amateurism” too nebulous a concept, too poorly defined even by the NCAA, to serve as the basis for denying modest payments.<br />The term “amateur” has never had a straightforward meaning. It comes from French, which in turn took it from the Latin root “amator,” meaning “lover” or “enthusiastic admirer.” When the word was borrowed into English in the 18th century, it developed a range of subtle nuances.<br />Following its original Latin sense, “amateur” could simply refer to someone who is enthusiastic about something. In 1788, a writer for The European Magazine and London Review remarked that the architectural work on Carlton House, a royal residence, “must be highly pleasing to every amateur of the fine arts.”"
