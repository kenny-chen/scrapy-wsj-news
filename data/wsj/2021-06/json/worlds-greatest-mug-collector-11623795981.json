    "body": "They called Charles Hubbell “Cup Man.” By the time he died in 2019, Mr. Hubbell had jammed coffee mugs into every square inch in his garage and barn in Culleoka, Tenn., south of Nashville—more than 23,000 mugs in all.<br />This odd collection began with a common problem. Dorothy Hubbell was running out of room for mugs in the kitchen, so she delivered 16 of them to the garage, where her husband hung them from nails driven into a wood beam. Friends took note and offered their own mugs. Five years later, when Charles hung his 10,000th mug, local media deemed it newsworthy and soon folks from across Central Tennessee were dropping off unwanted mugs at the Hubbell home.<br />I thought about this the other day as I counted the 43 mugs I’ve accumulated. One has a photo of a Shih Tzu; another is a souvenir from a hotel in Dixville Notch, N.H. There’s a red mug with white hearts that I use once a year to serve coffee to my wife, Amy, on Valentine’s Day.<br />Mugs, like books, are difficult to throw away. That’s why I still have one, never used, with a photo of Donny and Marie Osmond, a gift for appearing on their TV show in 1998.<br />A cherished light-blue mug was painted by my daughter Stephanie when she was 9. It says “Happy Father’s Day.” I don’t think the glaze was properly applied, so I use it to hold toothbrushes."
