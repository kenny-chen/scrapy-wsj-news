    "body": "Some investors are preparing for wild swings in financial markets, worried that inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s pledge to let it rise, will lead to a more volatile world.<br />The reason: The economic policies aiming to create inflation now are the opposite of the ones that kept markets relatively stable for decades.<br />Simplify Asset Management recently launched the Interest Rate Hedge ETF, which will seek to take advantage of what its backers see as a titanic shift in markets and is designed specifically to gain from rising longer-term Treasury yields.<br />The ETF, run by Harley Bassman, a former Merrill Lynch trader who developed a widely followed measure of bond-market volatility known as the MOVE index, will put half its cash in long-term Treasurys and half in long-term options that gain if seven-year interest rates rise above 4.25%.<br />That is high compared with current seven-year Treasury yields of about 1.25%. But at higher levels of rates, between 3.5% and 5%, stock and bond prices become more volatile and move in sync—so this ETF is meant to protect investors from that outcome too, Mr. Bassman said."
