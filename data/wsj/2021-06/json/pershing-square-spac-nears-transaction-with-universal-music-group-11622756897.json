    "body": "Breaking News...<br />Hedge-fund billionaire William Ackman’s special-purpose acquisition company is nearing a transaction with Universal Music Group that would value the world’s largest music business at about $40 billion, people familiar with the matter said.<br />The deal would be the largest SPAC transaction on record, exceeding the roughly $35 billion that Singaporean ride-hailing company Grab Holdings Inc. was valued at in a similar deal recently, according to Dealogic. It would have a so-called enterprise value, taking into consideration Universal’s debt, of about $42 billion.<br />It’s not guaranteed Universal and the SPAC,  Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd. ,  will reach a deal. If they do, it could be finalized in the next few weeks and isn’t subject to any additional due diligence, the people said.<br />—Anne Steele and Corrie Driebusch contributed to this article."
