    "body": "Peter Chaveas, a longtime officer in the U.S. Foreign Service, defends the flying of diversity flags at our embassies throughout the world and argues that America is as admired for confessing “failures and shortcomings” as it is for successes (“Another View on Diversity of Flags at Our Embassies,” Letters, June 17). Thank you for your service.<br />Overlooked alike by critics and defenders of the practice is the subliminal message that Black Lives Matter and rainbow gay-pride flags signal a new caste system in the U.S., one that designates favored groups immune from criticism for their excesses and disfavored “privileged” groups against whom it is legitimate to discriminate and demonize.<br />John Ambrose<br />Wayne, N.J.<br />"
