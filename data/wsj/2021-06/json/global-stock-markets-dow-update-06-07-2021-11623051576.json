    "body": "U.S. stock futures paused Monday, indicating that markets could be subdued after closing near record levels last week.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 were relatively flat. The index rose to its second-highest close in history Friday after the monthly employment report showed the labor market continued its slow recovery in May. Futures on the Nasdaq-100 edged down 0.2% Monday, pointing to tepid declines in large technology stocks.<br />The major indexes have been mostly subdued in recent trading sessions, with investors assessing a range of factors including the economic outlook, supply-chains problems and high valuations for stocks. While inflation expectations have eased in recent days, investors remain on edge for signs that Federal Reserve officials may consider pulling back on easy money policies that have supported the rally in equities.<br />“It almost feels like the market is going to be at a standstill until we get a better clarity on inflation and the growth outlook,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Advisors. “The market hasn’t got any major driver to push it significantly higher.”<br />Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Bloomberg News that President Biden’s spending plan would be good for the U.S., even if it contributes to rising inflation and results in higher interest rates."
