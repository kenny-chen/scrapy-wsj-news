    "body": "It’s getting harder to believe Dr. Anthony Fauci’s claim that his government agency never funded “gain-of-function” research to engineer new viruses at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. Meanwhile, Thursday brings a timely reminder of who ultimately oversees that lab in Wuhan.<br />It’s the Chinese Communist Party, which this week celebrates its 100th anniversary. Lowlights along the way include the killing of tens of millions of Chinese citizens in the 1950s and ’60s. The party’s current governance is also not without its flaws.<br />The Journal’s James Areddy writes:<br />On the other side of the world, it seems that many Americans who cherish their freedom do not approve of unelected elites in government. This column will offer its usual disclaimer that public opinion research is not a hard science, but if new findings from Scott Rasmussen are even close to accurate, they are highly compelling:<br />Speaking of doubting the federal experts, this week also brings a new report that will do nothing to enhance the credibility of perhaps the world’s most famous government expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci."
