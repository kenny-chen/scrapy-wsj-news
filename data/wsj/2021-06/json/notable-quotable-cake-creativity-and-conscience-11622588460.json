    "body": "From “Why I Didn’t ‘Just Bake the Cake’ ” by Masterpiece Cakeshop proprietor Jack Phillips for First Things, May 28:<br /><br />Where do we think artistic creativity comes from? . . . It’s water from the fountain of our soul. . . That’s why I say that I’ll serve any person, but I won’t communicate all messages. Serving people is merely about recognizing each individual as a person worthy of respect, made in the image of God. I’m not trying to force any person to see the world the way I do, or to embrace my beliefs about God and the Bible. If you want to reject Jesus and purchase a cupcake, go ahead. I’ll gladly sell you that cupcake, and a cup of coffee to go with it, maybe even engage in a conversation about our differences.<br />But asking me to draw on my creativity to communicate a message I believe is wrong? That’s asking me to stop being me. . . . To deny the deepest convictions of my heart, and pretend I haven’t learned the most difficult lessons of my life, or that they don’t matter. That’s not something any person has the right to ask of another. Or a command any government has the right to force one of its citizens to obey."
