    "body": "When President Biden signed legislation making June 19, or Juneteenth, a new national holiday, he set off a race inside corporations to figure out how to mark it and whether to allocate more paid time off to workers.<br />Employers from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  Bank of America Corp.  to  Stanley Black & Decker Inc.  and Ohio State University were among the organizations around the U.S. that quickly rolled out new holiday policies for workers, with some allowing people to take Friday off with mere hours of notice.<br />A key question for many companies has been whether to grant more paid time off at all. This week’s legislation to create the first federal holiday in nearly four decades came together quickly, prompting companies to make decisions about whether to give time now—or later—or offer a floating holiday or no time off.<br />Some opted to make Friday or Monday a holiday, since June 19 falls on a weekend this year. Other employers said they would offer an extra flex day to take off later. Many more are still trying to decide how to respond.<br />Stanley Black & Decker said it would begin officially observing Juneteenth as a company holiday for all U.S. employees starting in 2022, but also quickly rolled out a companywide day off on Friday."
