    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Pianist Noah Haidu had just entered his teens in the mid-1980s when he heard Kenny Kirkland playing piano on recordings by the pop singer and bassist Sting. Entranced by Kirkland’s style, he was drawn into the jazz sensibility of which it spoke. Kirkland, who died in 1998 at age 43, was never anything close to a household name. Nevertheless, he made a distinctive mark in jazz, especially in bands led by trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and saxophonist Branford Marsalis. Mr. Haidu’s “Doctone,” released last year, was dedicated to Kirkland’s music. Now, for his latest album, Mr. Haidu has turned his focus to another pianist, Keith Jarrett—as near a household name as we get in jazz and instrumental music."
