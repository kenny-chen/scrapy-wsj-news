    "body": "WASHINGTON—European diplomats and business groups are urging President Biden to lift the 15-month-old ban on travel from Europe and the United Kingdom after both began accepting American travelers, saying the lack of reciprocation hinders economic recovery and separates families.<br />The ban, instituted by President Trump near the start of the global Covid-19 pandemic, has hampered the operations of businesses that need European workers in the U.S., diplomats in Washington said. The EU earlier this month began permitting travel from the U.S. Americans can also visit the U.K. with stringent testing and quarantine rules.<br />“We raise this in every official meeting,” one European diplomat said.<br />Another diplomat said: “The current system is self-evidently unfair and is still based on the Covid situation of over a year ago.”<br />Additionally, tens of thousands of Europeans who hold visas to work or study in the U.S. and could travel despite the ban are unable to do so because of processing backlogs at U.S. embassies and consulates. Those already in the U.S. cannot visit their home countries because they cannot obtain the documents required to return."
