    "body": "Tobacco giant  Altria Group Inc.  is on trial, accused of breaking antitrust laws by abandoning its e-cigarette business at the request of rival Juul Labs Inc. The Marlboro maker’s defense: Our e-cigarettes were lousy.<br />To make its case, Altria has asked its own executives to disclose, in detail, their litany of failures.<br />On the witness stand, current and former Altria executives have recounted how the company threw hundreds of millions of dollars at developing a vaping product, yet failed to come up with anything smokers liked.<br />According to the executives’ testimonies: Altria’s e-cigarettes leaked. They generated high formaldehyde levels. They lacked the nicotine kick smokers were looking for.<br />The bad news was so frequent, according to trial testimony this month, that a scientist who updated executives on the company’s e-cigarette products earned the nickname “Dr. Doom.”"
