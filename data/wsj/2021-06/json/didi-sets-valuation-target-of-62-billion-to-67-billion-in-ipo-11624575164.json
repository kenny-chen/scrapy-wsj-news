    "body": "Didi Global Inc., the Beijing-based ride-hailing company, is targeting a valuation of $62 billion to $67 billion in its IPO, according to its latest public filing.<br />The fully diluted valuation, which typically includes restricted stock units, could eclipse $70 billion, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal.<br />Didi is looking to raise $3.9 billion in the initial public offering by selling 288 million American depositary shares, assuming they price at the midpoint of its targeted range of $13 to $14 per ADS, the filing said.<br />Didi, which recently changed its corporate name, has said it would use the money it raises to invest in technology, grow its business outside of China and introduce new products.<br />Much like  Uber Technologies Inc.  in the U.S., Chinaâ€™s Didi operates a smartphone app where users can hail rides, regular taxis and carpooling services. Didi is known for successfully pushing Uber out of China, winning a harsh price war that ended in 2016 when Uber merged its China unit with Didi in exchange for a stake in Didi."
