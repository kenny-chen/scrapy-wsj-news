    "body": "“Investors are growing more fearful of a Fed mistake,” says a headline at corporate cousin Marketwatch. “A survey now finds ‘central bank policy error’ is the third biggest risk to the market,” writes Steve Goldstein. But he also notes that “higher-than-expected inflation and bond yields” were identified as the biggest risk, which many may eventually count in the category of Fed policy errors. The survey comes from  Deutsche Bank ,  which finds such concerns rising since April.<br />Fortunately investors aren’t the only ones growing concerned. While the president of the New York Fed still isn’t ready to turn off the emergency money spigot, other Fed regional bank presidents are beginning to recognize that the post-Covid economy has been rising for a while and doesn’t need gargantuan federal intervention.<br />The Journal’s Michael Derby reports:<br />These purchases, executed with money created by the Fed, have roughly doubled the Fed’s balance sheet since the start of the crisis. Yet with the emergency over, the money printing continues. Mr. Derby notes:<br />Many consumers are no doubt hoping the Fed will recognize 5% inflation as a good moment to lay off the accelerator."
