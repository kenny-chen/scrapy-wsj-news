    "body": "NextNav Holdings LLC is combining with a special-purpose acquisition company that would take the next-generation GPS firm public and value it at about $1.2 billion, the companies said.<br />Founded in 2007, NextNav says its platforms can locate a device’s specific indoor positioning, including what floor of a building it is on. Vertical positioning data are a focus for regulators to improve responses to 911 emergency calls in urban areas and could have consumer applications in sectors like gaming and transportation that require a device’s specific location. NextNav owns licenses to use wireless airwaves that support nationwide telecom networks.<br />The McLean, Va., company has reached a deal to merge with the SPAC Spartacus Acquisition Corp., the firms said Thursday. The Wall Street Journal had previously reported they were nearing an agreement. Spartacus is focused on deals in the technology, media and telecom industries.<br />NextNav is expected to generate roughly $410 million in cash through the deal from the money held by the SPAC and a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, associated with the merger. PIPE investors in the deal include Koch Strategic Platforms, a subsidiary of Koch Investments Group, and funds managed by Fortress Investment Group.<br />Existing NextNav investors include funds managed by Fortress and funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. XM Satellite Radio founder Gary Parsons is the chairman of NextNav’s board."
