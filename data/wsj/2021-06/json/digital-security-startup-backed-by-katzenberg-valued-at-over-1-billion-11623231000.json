    "body": "Aura, a company backed by Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg and Silicon Valley investor Sujay Jaswa, raised $150 million to help further its bid to become a one-stop offering for online security.<br />The funding round, led by private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, brings the company’s war chest to $450 million and values the company at more than $1 billion, Aura officials said.<br />Aura this week is rolling out an all-in-one digital-security product that includes antivirus and identity-protection software for consumers, and the company plans to launch an advertising campaign later this year. Previously it offered different products for various digital-security threats. Many of those products came through acquisitions.<br />Aura is on track to generate roughly $220 million in revenue in 2021 from more than 1.7 million customers world-wide and is profitable, the officials said.<br />“Everything we’ve done up until now was to put together the rocket ship,” Mr. Katzenberg, who recently joined Aura’s board, said in an interview. “This investment is the rocket fuel to make it the safety product for consumers around the globe.”"
