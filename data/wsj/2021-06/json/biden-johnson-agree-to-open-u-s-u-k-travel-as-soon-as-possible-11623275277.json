    "body": "PLYMOUTH, England—President Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will seek to ease Covid-19 travel restrictions as part of a wide-ranging “Atlantic Charter” before this week’s Group of Seven meeting, according to Mr. Johnson’s office.<br />The charter, a riff on the historic joint statement made by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 as their vision for a democratic world post-World War II, will be unveiled Thursday. The meeting will be the first between the two nations' leaders since Mr. Biden’s election.<br />Following the Thursday meeting, Messrs. Biden and Johnson are expected to announce the formation of a task force with the goal of reopening travel between the U.S. and the U.K. as soon as possible.<br />The pandemic ground most global travel, including between the two countries, to a halt. As more people get vaccinated, countries around the world are lifting restrictions, allowing for business and leisure travel.<br />In March 2020, then-President Donald Trump barred most travel into the U.S. from the U.K. by noncitizens. In recent months, major airlines have urged the Biden administration to lift the restrictions."
