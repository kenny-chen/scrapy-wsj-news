    "body": "JPMorgan  Chase & Co. is redoubling efforts to revive a type of mortgage that largely died out after the last financial crisis.<br />The bank is reinvesting in an electronic clearinghouse for “private-label“ mortgages, which are packaged and sold to investors without a guarantee from a government-backed firm like Fannie Mae. The market has been growing during this year’s hot housing market.<br />The investment bank has contributed additional venture capital funding to Maxex LLC, a growing digital exchange for residential mortgages, executives at both companies said. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.<br />Maxex connects sellers and buyers of the home loans, providing standardized documentation so they can be easily purchased by financial firms. Those firms invest in the loans or bundle them into mortgage-backed bonds, or securitizations, they sell to others.<br />“If there’s a segment of finance that has lagged in utilization of technology it’s the mortgage business—it’s remarkably inefficient,” said James Bennison, an executive at insurer Arch Capital Group, which bought about $120 million of loans on the Maxex platform this year."
