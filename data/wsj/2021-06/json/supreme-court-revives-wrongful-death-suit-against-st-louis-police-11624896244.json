    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court took a harder line against police misconduct Monday, ordering a lower court to reconsider whether St. Louis officers used excessive force in 2015 when kneeling on a shackled suspect who later died.<br />The order, among dozens of actions by the justices including in a closely watched case on transgender rights, came as the court cleared its docket in its final week before starting its summer break. The court also turned away notable cases involving work-from-home income taxes and marijuana.<br />In the excessive-force case, the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis had dismissed a lawsuit filed by Nicholas Gilbert’s parents, concluding that the officers acted reasonably after finding Mr. Gilbert apparently attempting to hang himself while in a holding cell.<br />Several officers responded, but Mr. Gilbert, 5’3” and 160 pounds, resisted, and a struggle ensued. Ultimately, officers shackled Mr. Gilbert and held him on his stomach.<br />“Three officers held Gilbert’s limbs down at the shoulders, biceps, and legs. At least one other placed pressure on Gilbert’s back and torso. Gilbert tried to raise his chest, saying, ‘It hurts. Stop,’” the court’s unsigned opinion said."
