    "body": "The Biden administration is moving to restore protections for endangered animals and plants that were loosened under former President Donald Trump, a move that had triggered lawsuits from environmental groups.<br />In an announcement on Friday, U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials said they plan to strengthen rules that protect threatened species, including the restoration of an earlier process for designating critical habitat. The new rules are expected to take several months to draft and implement.<br />Fish and Wildlife Service Principal Deputy Director Martha Williams said in a statement that her office is working with industry groups to “not only protect and recover America’s imperiled wildlife but to ensure cornerstone laws like the Endangered Species Act are helping us meet 21st century challenges.”<br />Michael Mittelholzer of the National Association of Home Builders criticized the proposed changes, saying that the Trump administration had made common-sense improvements.<br />“Returning to an inefficient ESA permitting process will not only raise the cost of housing, but will also delay countless other infrastructure projects that require either a federal permit or use federal funds,” he said."
