    "body": "MOSCOW—A Russian court declared the opposition network of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny as extremist in a move that bans the groups, the Kremlin’s most definitive step yet to eradicate political resistance in the country.<br />The ruling comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month signed a law that prevents anyone belonging to an extremist organization from running for office, essentially sidelining Mr. Navalny’s nationwide movement from challenging the ruling United Russia party in September’s parliamentary elections.<br />The decision raises the stakes ahead of next week’s summit between Mr. Putin and President Biden in Geneva where the U.S. president is expected to raise human-rights issues. Mr. Putin has previously dismissed Western criticism of Russia’s handling of Mr. Navalny’s case and has tried to portray international support for Mr. Navalny as proof that he and his supporters are agents of the West, bent on destabilizing Russia.<br />With Mr. Navalny serving a 2½-year prison sentence for violating parole conditions on charges he says are trumped up, political observers see Mr. Putin’s using the opportunity to neutralize his movement and also strike a blow against the personal legacy of the Kremlin critic.<br />After the verdict was announced late Wednesday in Moscow, Mr. Navalny vowed to continue opposing Mr. Putin."
