    "body": "Five years after the vote that pulled the U.K. out of the European Union, the British government this week tried to persuade schoolchildren across the country to belt out a new anthem expressing their love for the motherland, “One Britain One Nation.”<br />It didn’t go so well.<br />On Friday morning, some schoolchildren sang the song, with lyrics such as “We are Britain and we have one dream—to unite all people in one great team” and “We stand together with pride in our hearts, united forever, never apart.”<br />The young students, mostly around the Bradford area in northern England, where the campaign began, gathered outside to sing or drew pictures of people holding hands before waving paper flags.<br />But many schools around the country opted out, saying singing runs up against Covid-19 restrictions."
