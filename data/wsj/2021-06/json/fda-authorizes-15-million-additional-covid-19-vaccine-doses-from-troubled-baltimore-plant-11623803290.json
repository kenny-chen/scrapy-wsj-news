    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration cleared an additional batch of  Johnson & Johnson  Covid-19 vaccine doses Tuesday from a troubled production plant in Baltimore.<br />The agency cleared 15 million doses, bringing the total doses authorized for export  to 25 million, according to a senior U.S. official.<br />The FDA on Friday cleared about 10 million doses for export.<br />The FDA previously rejected about 60 million J&J doses from that plant because of possible contamination. The Baltimore contract-manufacture site, run by  Emergent BioSolutions Inc.,  originally made vaccines for J&J and another vaccine company,  AstraZeneca  PLC. By this spring, the FDA found that Emergent hadn’t taken measures to avoid cross-contamination between the two vaccine lines.<br />There are still more than 100 million vaccine doses or unbottled dose equivalents in the plant’s inventory, from both companies, awaiting FDA action. The agency is expected to make a decision on the AstraZeneca vaccine later this week or next week, according to the senior U.S. official."
