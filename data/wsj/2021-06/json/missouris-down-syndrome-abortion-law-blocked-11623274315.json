    "body": "A divided federal appeals court Wednesday blocked Missouri from enforcing a law limiting abortions for women who want to terminate a fetus for fear that it has Down syndrome.<br />The three-judge panel also blocked other provisions of the law that banned most abortions after eight weeks gestational age.<br />The Republican-led Legislature passed the “Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act” in 2019, among a wave of similar abortion restrictions enacted by conservative-leaning states in recent years.<br />The Missouri law makes it illegal for a physician to perform an abortion upon learning that the patient wants the procedure solely because she fears the fetus has Down syndrome.<br />Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri filed suit challenging the law as unconstitutional, representing abortion clinics in the St. Louis area."
