    "body": "A CVS in suburban New York is selling summer toys and canned food in an aisle previously used for Covid-19 shots. Hundreds of  Rite Aid Corp.  stores will end extended Friday vaccine hours. Mass-inoculation sites set up to administer thousands of shots daily are shutting down across the country.<br />America’s rapid mobilization to vaccinate the masses against Covid-19 is entering a new phase.<br />Covid-19 vaccines are no longer a scarce commodity in the U.S. as supply now outstrips waning demand, and getting a shot is becoming akin to getting a flu shot, easy and generally uneventful. The shift comes as the U.S. is set to fall short of President Biden’s goal for 70% of the adult population to receive at least one dose by July 4.<br />The Biden administration has said it plans to export 80 million donated doses by the end of the month to alleviate global shortages, both through Covax, the international vaccine effort, and directly with partners based on regional need.<br />For the U.S. public, there will be fewer vaccine locations to choose from as government-run sites shut down. Among the locations recently closed are mass-vaccination sites at Chicago’s United Center, Boston’s Reggie Lewis Center and a handful of large-scale clinics throughout New York. But it also means easier access to shots at retail pharmacies, which no longer require appointments or screen recipients based on need."
