    "body": "Shares of  Weatherford International  PLC, once the world’s fourth-largest oil-field services company before being felled by an oil bust, are set to be relisted on the Nasdaq stock exchange Wednesday, a sign of the industry’s slow but steady recovery.<br />The company will trade under the symbol WFRD.<br />Weatherford trailed only  Schlumberger Ltd. ,  Halliburton Co.  and  Baker Hughes Co.  among the largest oil-field services providers before crude prices collapsed in 2015. Weatherford struggled to repay its debts, which totaled about $8.3 billion when it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019.<br />Then the coronavirus pandemic struck last year, just months after Weatherford emerged from chapter 11, decimating demand for oil and gas. That forced Weatherford to shed jobs, cut costs and pare down assets, as energy producers slashed capital spending, the lifeblood of oil-field services companies.<br />With fuel demand and oil-industry activity picking up again, Weatherford is now looking to expand its market share in advanced energy technologies in the midst of steadier results, Chief Executive Officer Girish Saligram said in an interview."
