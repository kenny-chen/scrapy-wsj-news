    "body": "Not long into his freshman year at Villanova University, Mikal Bridges realized something peculiar: He wasn’t ready for college basketball.<br />He decided to redshirt. This was extraordinarily odd for someone with his future. The players who become lottery picks in the NBA draft are precocious talents who go to campus only because they’re not allowed in the pros. They’re not in need of an extra season to prepare their bodies to compete against other teenagers.<br />That was six years ago. But the same player who wasn’t big enough, strong enough or physically capable enough for the college game now finds himself with an unlikely job for the Phoenix Suns in the NBA playoffs: Mikal Bridges is responsible for defending LeBron James.<br />“It’s mind-blowing to me. It really is. That’s my baby out there guarding LeBron,” said Tyneeha Rivers, his mother. “He was this skinny kid—and now look at him.”<br />The easiest way to spot Bridges during a Suns game is to search for the other team’s best player. The chances are there will be a spindly guy with arms like javelins right beside him."
