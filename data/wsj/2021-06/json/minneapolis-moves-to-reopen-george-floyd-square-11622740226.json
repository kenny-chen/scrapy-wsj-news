    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS—The city of Minneapolis on Thursday began clearing roadblocks and debris in the area that has come to be called George Floyd Square, taking the first steps to reopening it to traffic and police patrols, which have been absent since Mr. Floyd was killed last year.<br />The site at East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue has become a gathering place as a memorial to the 46-year-old Black man and the racial-justice movement sparked by his May 25, 2020, death.<br />The city removed jersey barriers and debris from the area, and it was briefly open to traffic before some residents reconstructed temporary barriers, setting up a tense divide in the neighborhood between those who want to move forward and those who want to preserve a police- and traffic-free zone.<br />“It will be a bit touch and go and difficult over the next several days,” said Mayor Jacob Frey in a media briefing, adding that the effort to reopen the area had strong backing from local businesses and some community groups.<br />Business owners have complained about lack of access for their customers caused by the closing of the several-block area to traffic and about crime that has occurred in the absence of a police presence in the area."
