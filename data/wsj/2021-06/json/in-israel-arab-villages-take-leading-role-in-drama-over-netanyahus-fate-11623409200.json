    "body": "KHASHEM ZANNEH, Israel—In his campaign to thwart a rival coalition that seeks to end his 12-year rule as soon as Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is turning to a stretch of ramshackle huts in the desert of southern Israel.<br />Hundreds of families live in homes made of tin or cinder block along a highway that runs through Israel from the Gaza Strip to Jordan. Khashem Zanneh lacks a power grid and paved roads and has no supermarket or even a school for its children.<br />The village and 34 other Bedouin communities lack such basic infrastructure because neither Israel’s courts nor its government has ever recognized the communities, leaving their residents in legal limbo.<br />The Bedouins are demanding Israel rectify the situation, but for now, all new construction is considered illegal and subject to demolition.<br />“For 70 years, the state has looked at us like a group of outlaws,” says Dr. Kayed al-Athamen, 41 years old, who has for years dreamed of building his village’s first health clinic. “The time has come for [the state] to treat us like everyone else.”"
