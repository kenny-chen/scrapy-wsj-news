    "body": "The “reopening trade” has posed a real challenge to King Dollar, but there could be a limit to how much power this monarchy is willing to give back.<br />The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, has been on an almost nonstop slide since the start of April. This past week, though, it has stood its ground, despite the fact that U.S. payroll numbers released Friday were weaker than economists expected.<br />It may be a sign that the dollar’s depreciation has largely run its course. If that is the case, it would remove a powerful tailwind from some markets, because asset prices denominated in dollars tend to move to offset shifts in the exchange rate. Commodities, for example, are up 32% in dollar terms since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, but only 17% in euros. As for oil, currently a popular bet, the currency has accounted for about two thirds of its gains.<br />Last year, a dash to safety initially pushed the WSJ Dollar Index up 8% relative to the start of 2020. As fiscal and monetary stimulus was deployed to fight the pandemic, the panic unwound. The move had completely reversed by November, but the dollar kept falling.<br />Anticipation of a synchronized global recovery tends to help shares that trade at cheap levels relative to earnings, which means looking overseas. European stocks have outperformed American ones in 2021."
