    "body": "WASHINGTON—Some countries might try to stay outside the emerging agreement to impose a global minimum tax on corporations so those nations can use low tax rates to attract businesses. The Biden administration aims to deflect those attempts with a powerful Shield.<br />The Shield—the Stopping Harmful Inversions and Ending Low-Tax Developments rule—is the administration’s tax threat to the rest of the world, the flip side of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s cooperative diplomacy.<br />The plan, which would require the approval of Congress, aims to leverage the size of the U.S. consumer market to give other countries a choice: impose a minimum tax or watch the U.S. tax your companies and take your revenue. It is an aggressive weapon and one that mirrors how the U.S. changed its tax laws in 2010 to prod foreign banks into identifying Americans’ offshore accounts to the Internal Revenue Service.<br />The Shield faces some significant potential hurdles in Congress, along with likely resistance from foreign governments and multinational businesses.<br />“Instead of this being called the Shield it should be called the sword, because that’s the way it’s intended,” said Bob Stack of Deloitte Tax LLP, who was a Treasury Department international tax official during the Obama administration."
