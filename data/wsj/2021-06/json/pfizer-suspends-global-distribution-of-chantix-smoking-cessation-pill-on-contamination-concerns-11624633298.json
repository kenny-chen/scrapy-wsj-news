    "body": "Pfizer Inc.  has suspended distribution world-wide of antismoking pill Chantix and recalled some lots after finding they contained heightened levels of a probable carcinogen, a company spokesman said.<br />The drugmaker is doing more testing to determine whether additional Chantix lots contain elevated amounts of the likely carcinogen, known as nitrosamines, according to the spokesman.<br />As a precaution, Pfizer suspended distribution while determining the extent of the contamination, the spokesman said.<br />The company said it was testing lots for the presence of nitrosamines at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators. It didn’t specify the number of lots affected or where they were found.<br />Pfizer, of New York City, said the drug’s benefits outweigh the potential risks, if any, posed by nitrosamine exposure from Chantix."
