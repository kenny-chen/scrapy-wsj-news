    "body": "Competition among so-called blank-check companies to find mergers is already stiff. Share-price declines and a ticking clock to take companies public are ratcheting up the pressure.<br />The new challenges for creators of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, result in part from the abundance of the deals that raised money early in 2021. Looming over these firms is a two-year deadline to do a deal or hand back cash to investors.<br />Now that shares of many SPAC-related companies have fallen, fewer startups are interested in going public through a SPAC. That mismatch is intensifying competition between some blank-check firms for the same private firms, known by some on Wall Street as a “SPAC-off.”<br />SPACs are shell companies that raise money and list on an exchange with the sole intent of merging with a private firm to take it public. The private company, often a startup, then gets the SPAC’s place in the stock market. Blank-check mergers let companies going public make future business projections—which aren’t allowed in regular IPOs—one reason they took Wall Street by storm this winter and have raised a record $105 billion this year, according to SPAC Research.<br />But with SPAC shares in retreat, many blank-check firms now trade below their debut price. Many companies in recent months have said that several different SPACs have asked them about mergers, a trend that contributed to the frenzy in the sector."
