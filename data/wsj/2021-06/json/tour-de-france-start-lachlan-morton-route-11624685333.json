    "body": "In the hours after the Tour de France peloton sets off from Brittany on Saturday, pro cyclist Lachlan Morton will hop on his bike and start pedaling on the same route, far behind teammates that he won’t see again for three weeks.<br />Yet by Saturday evening, Morton should be well ahead of them. And as they retreat to their French hotel for dinner and a massage after Stage 1, Morton will still be on the bike. In fact, between Saturday and July 18, he will spend more time on the saddle than off it and ride hundreds more miles than the Tour’s eventual winner.<br />Morton is attempting on a journey to cover the route of the world’s most famous bike race supported only by what he can carry with him. That means no team cars, no mechanics, and practically no hotels.<br />This is the Tour de France’s hardest solo breakaway. (Track his progress here.)<br />Running in parallel to the race, Morton plans to pedal through all 3,383 kilometers (2,102 miles) of the official distance by himself. Because he’s eschewing the luxury of a team bus, he will also ride the distance between the stages, making his route more than 60% longer than the actual race."
