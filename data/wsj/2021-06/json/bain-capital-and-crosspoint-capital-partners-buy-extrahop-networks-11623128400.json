    "body": "Two private-equity firms are buying cybersecurity company ExtraHop Networks Inc. for $900 million, as a series of recent high-profile ransomware attacks have put cybersecurity risk back in the spotlight.<br />Bain Capital Private Equity and Crosspoint Capital Partners have agreed to acquire ExtraHop, which provides network detection and response services, including combating ransomware attacks, according to ExtraHop Chief Executive Arif Kareem.<br />The technology business aims to prevent security breaches, uncover such breaches when they occur and monitor behavioral changes across cloud, data center and Internet of Things networks for potential cyber threats. ExtraHop’s customers include  Ulta Beauty Inc.,  Home Depot Inc., Texas Children’s Hospital and Gas South LLC, among others.<br />Ransomware attacks have made headlines in recent months across a range of industries. Last week meatpacking company JBS SA  and a ferry service in Massachusetts were hit by ransomware attacks. Just a month before, a similar attack struck Colonial Pipeline Co., one of the largest fuel pipeline operators in the U.S. Colonial’s chief executive authorized the payment of $4.4 million to the hackers to get the pipeline—which provides about 45% of the fuel for the East Coast—back online.<br />Founded in 2007, ExtraHop generated more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue during the first quarter of this year and expects to increase revenue by 40% in 2021, according to Mr. Kareem. He said the company has seen interest in its product more than double in the past three months or so, citing an uptick in requests for more information by potential clients, driven by heightened cyberattack concerns."
