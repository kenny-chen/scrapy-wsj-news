    "body": "TAIPEI—The U.S. will revive trade and investment talks with Taiwan next week in a move intended to draw Washington and Taipei closer that also is likely to irk Beijing.<br />The de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei, the American Institute of Taiwan, said Friday that its director, Brent Christensen, and Taiwan’s representative in the U.S., Bi-Khim Hsiao, will convene a meeting by videoconference Wednesday with participants from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and Taiwan’s trade office.<br />An announcement was anticipated after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month that Washington planned to engage with Taiwan soon on trade, without sharing a timeline.<br />The two sides will engage under a trade and investment framework first signed in 1994. Such agreements create the basis for recurring dialogue on trade issues, and sometimes serve a precursor to full-fledged free-trade agreements. Taipei and Washington last met under the framework in 2016.<br />Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
