    "body": "In “Liberals Choose Racial Catharsis Over Progress for Blacks” (Upward Mobility, June 2), Jason L. Riley writes: “These historical milestones are certainly worthy of commemoration. . . . Yet for progressives and their friends in the media, the events are also an opportunity to push for racial preferences and bigger government.” I appreciate that he argues from the right to appeal to readers on the right, but a more balanced approach might have encouraged readers on the left to find a modicum of comfort in the rest of his piece. Or is it, perhaps, that balance has no place in the media, left or right, today? Historian Frederick Jackson Turner said: “The aim of history, then, is to know the elements of the present by understanding what came into the present from the past.” Most Americans know little about the black American experience. I would argue that the left is doing a better job than the right to correct that deficiency.<br />William F. Collopy<br />Houston"
