    "body": "<br />Several gun-control measures, judicial nominations and a bill letting sexual-abuse victims sue their attackers are on New York state lawmakers’ to-do lists as they wrap up their annual legislative session this week in Albany.<br />Advocates are pushing Democrats who dominate the state Assembly and Senate to take up a series of measures, some of which have already cleared one legislative house, before the lawmakers’ scheduled adjournment on Thursday.<br />Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie told Democratic members in a Thursday afternoon conference that the chamber planned to vote on bills that would jump-start the process of counting absentee ballots in elections and prohibit the sale of untraceable weapons assembled from kits, known as “ghost guns,”  lawmakers said.<br />But several other measures remain up in the air, Assembly members said, including changes to parole laws designed to move people out of jail, and a bill that would extend the pandemic-related authorization of restaurants to sell alcohol to go."
