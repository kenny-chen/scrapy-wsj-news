    "body": "WASHINGTON—A forthcoming U.S. intelligence report contains no evidence that unexplained objects moving through the skies and witnessed by U.S. Navy pilots are alien spacecraft, but offers no conclusive explanation for the mysterious sightings, according to people familiar with its contents.<br />The report, due to be delivered to Congress later this month, appears unlikely to quell a debate over what the Pentagon calls “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena,” which pilots have observed moving at hypersonic speeds and conducting maneuvers that would be impossible using known technology.<br />Former President Barack Obama acknowledged last month that the U.S. government has no explanation for the strange objects.<br />“What is true, and I’m actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don’t know exactly what they are,” Mr. Obama told CBS. “We can’t explain how they move, their trajectory,” he said.<br />The draft report, the people familiar with it said, finds no evidence that the objects are alien spacecraft, but also no firm proof that they are not."
