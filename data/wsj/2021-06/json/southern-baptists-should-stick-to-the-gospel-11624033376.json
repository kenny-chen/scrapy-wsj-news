    "body": "Regarding “Southern Baptists Clash Over Future” (Page One, June 12): The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) got off track some years ago when it overlooked a time-tested truism: Jesus recognized only two classes of people—saved or unsaved. He didn’t consider male/female, slave/free, Jew/Gentile. Had Jesus focused on the social issues and activism of the day, the truth of the Gospel would never have been fully known and wouldn’t have spread throughout the world.<br />Like the hypocritical religious leaders of Jesus’ day who layered and added on to the simple truth of the Gospel by their requirements of what people should believe and do, the SBC has done the same thing some 2,000 years later by adding man-made requirements to its definition of what is a true Christian. Until the SBC realizes this and puts it into practice, membership will continue to decline.<br />Al Brown<br />St. Simons Island, Ga.<br />"
