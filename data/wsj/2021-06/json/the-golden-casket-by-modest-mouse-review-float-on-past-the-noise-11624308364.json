    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Modest Mouse fans are used to waiting. The band, led by vocalist and guitarist Isaac Brock, helped define the sound of Pacific Northwest indie rock—the group formed in Issaquah, Wash., and is now based in Portland, Ore.—in the latter part of the 1990s. In its first half-decade of existence, Modest Mouse cut three full-length records, including two doubles, along with scattered EPs and a clutch of singles. It successfully carried its idiosyncratic early style—Mr. Brock’s yelping vocals sometimes bring to mind the Pixies, while his ear for unusual song structures and inventive, emotionally stirring guitar lines are all his own—to a major label with 2000’s “The Moon & Antarctica.”<br />And then the slowdown started. Modest Mouse took four years to craft its platinum-selling commercial breakthrough, 2004’s “Good News for People Who Love Bad News,” and in the 16 years that followed managed only two more albums. “The Golden Casket” (Epic), its seventh LP, is out Friday. Like its two immediate predecessors, it’s sprinkled with forceful moments but is also frustratingly inconsistent."
