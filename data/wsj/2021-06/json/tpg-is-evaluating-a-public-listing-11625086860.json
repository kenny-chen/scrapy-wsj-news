    "body": "TPG, one of the last of the original private-equity giants to remain a closely held partnership, is evaluating a public listing, people familiar with the matter said.<br />The firm is considering a straightforward initial public offering and a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, with the former being the most likely route, the people said. Such a deal could value the California-and-Texas firm at about $10 billion, some of the people said.<br />The process is still in its early stages and TPG may not opt to proceed with any deal.<br />TPG, with nearly $100 billion in assets under management, has flirted with an IPO multiple times, only to end up balking while rivals forged ahead.  Blackstone Group Inc.,   Apollo Global Management Inc.,  KKR & Co. and Carlyle Group Inc. went public years ago, transforming businesses that have enjoyed rapid growth as the industry is flooded with assets.<br />“As we have consistently stated, we evaluate various strategic alternatives from time to time,” a TPG spokesman said in a statement. “No decisions have been made and we have nothing to announce at this time.”"
