    "body": "A celebrated Afghan fighter pilot trained by the American military, who hid for months with his wife and 5-year-old daughter from Taliban death threats, arrived in the U.S. after receiving temporary protection status.<br />Maj. Naiem Asadi’s case came under the spotlight late last year after Washington reversed its initial decision to help him leave Afghanistan and live in the U.S.<br />Maj. Asadi and his family left Kabul on Tuesday after the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, last month granted them parole—a temporary protection status for noncitizens in the country, according to his lawyer. During this period he can apply for asylum, the lawyer said.<br />“You can’t even imagine how happy I am,” Maj. Asadi said on the phone from New Jersey on Thursday, his voice giddy with excitement and his daughter playing noisily in the background.<br />It wasn’t immediately clear why the U.S. provided Maj. Asadi and his family safe passage now."
