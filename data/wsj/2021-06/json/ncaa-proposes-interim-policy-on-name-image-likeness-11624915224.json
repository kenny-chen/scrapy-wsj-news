    "body": "Under pressure to overhaul its vision of amateurism in college sports, the National Collegiate Athletic Association on Monday indicated that it would allow athletes in all 50 states to make money from their name, image and likeness as soon as July 1 without forfeiting their eligibility.<br />In making the move—which is still one step from final approval—the NCAA bowed to the actions of numerous state legislatures around the country, which have already moved to make it legal for college athletes to profit from their images. Some of those laws are set to take effect on Thursday.<br />The NCAA move continues a period of furious change that intensified last week ago with a landmark Supreme Court decision in which justices unanimously said the NCAA had unlawfully limited schools from competing for player talent by offering better benefits, harming college athletes in the process.<br />In a meeting Monday to address the rapidly changing environment surrounding college athlete rights, the NCAA Division I Council proposed an “interim policy” for the association that would suspend a bylaw that prohibits athletes from monetizing their name, image and likeness. The proposals must be approved by the NCAA Board of Directors, which meets Wednesday.<br />“While opening NIL activities to student-athletes, the policy leaves in place the commitment to avoid pay-for-play and improper inducements tied to choosing to attend a particular school,” said the NCAA in a statement."
