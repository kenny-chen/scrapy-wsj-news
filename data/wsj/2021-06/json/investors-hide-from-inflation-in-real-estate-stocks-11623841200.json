    "body": "Investors looking to cushion their portfolios against inflation helped real-estate stocks lead the S&P 500 in recent weeks.<br />The real-estate sector, which focuses on companies that rent properties, has gained 14% this quarter, more than double the 6.9% gain of the broader stock index.<br />As the economy recovers from its pandemic-induced slowdown, some investors are worried that rising prices could erode company profits and push the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates sooner than expected.<br />Money managers often turn to real-estate stocks when they anticipate higher inflation because of the segment’s pricing power. Some leases are tied to inflation and many tenants bear a rent increase to avoid the cost of moving. Other industries, such as restaurants and food retail, have more competition and a more price-sensitive consumer.<br />Consumer prices rose 5% in May from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Labor Department, the biggest surge in inflation in nearly 13 years. Investors are keeping a close eye on this week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve for any signal that officials expect to raise rates sooner than anticipated."
