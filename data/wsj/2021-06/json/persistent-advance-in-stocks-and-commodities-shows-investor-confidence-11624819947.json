    "body": "Stocks and commodities are surging together in a way few on Wall Street have ever seen, a sign that demand for riskier investments remains robust.<br />The S&P 500 and S&P GSCI gauge of commodities enter the last few days of the second quarter up about 8% and 13% for the period, respectively. This would mark the first time that both indexes climbed at least 5% in five consecutive quarters, according to a Dow Jones Market Data analysis of figures going back 50 years.<br />The S&P 500 hit a high last week, buoyed by gains in technology stalwarts like  Microsoft Corp .  as well as consumer-focused stocks such as  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc .<br />The persistent climb underscores how the broadest measures of market performance remain remarkably strong, masking volatility under the surface. Even as traders cope with mammoth swings in everything from  Tesla Inc .  to the price of lumber and concerns about the longer-term economic outlook, many investors remain confident that an expanding economy and rising corporate profits will support further gains.<br />And with returns from relatively safe assets such as bonds still limited due to ultralow interest rates—or even negative when factoring in inflation—traders keep favoring high-performing investments."
