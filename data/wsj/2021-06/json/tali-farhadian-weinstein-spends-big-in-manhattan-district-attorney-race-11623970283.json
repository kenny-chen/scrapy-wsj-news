    "body": "Manhattan district attorney candidate Tali Farhadian Weinstein is buying television and social-media advertising with millions of dollars of her own money, a spending spree in the final days before Tuesday’s primary that observers say is rare for a prosecutor election.<br />Ms. Farhadian Weinstein has contributed $8.2 million since May 17 from the personal fortune she shares with her husband, hedge-fund manager Boaz Weinstein, more than the combined total raised by her seven opponents in the Democratic primary. She spent 75% of it during the three weeks that followed, according to financial disclosures filed this month.<br />Other candidates and good-government advocates said Ms. Farhadian Weinstein is trying to buy the election.<br />“It’s really anti-democratic to sweep in at the last moment with a huge self-funding donation that is designed to get the least amount of scrutiny as possible,” said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, a nonpartisan group advocating for transparent government.<br />In addition to the self-funding, Ms. Farhadian Weinstein has raised $4.6 million, more than any other candidate, with hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from the finance sector."
