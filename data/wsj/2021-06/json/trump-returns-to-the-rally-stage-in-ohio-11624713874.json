    "body": "CLEVELAND—Former President Donald Trump’s unorthodox attempt to remain in the political spotlight after leaving the White House will take a more familiar turn Saturday when he hosts his first campaign-style rally in six months.<br />Mr. Trump’s predecessors in the White House—including those who also lost re-election bids—mostly avoided public political activity in the first year after leaving the West Wing. But the 75-year-old Republican has already made more than two-dozen endorsements in races for Congress, state Republican chairs and even to support a contender for Staten Island, N.Y., borough president.<br />Mr. Trump, who remains banned from posting on Facebook and Twitter, has also hosted more than a dozen journalists at his South Florida home in recent months for cable television, radio and book interviews.<br />The publicity tour and surge of endorsements have sparked questions about whether Mr. Trump will run again for the White House in 2024. The former reality TV star has helped fuel that speculation by responding to those queries with cliffhangers instead of direct answers.<br />“I’ll be making an announcement in the not-too-distant future,” Mr. Trump said in a Newsmax interview Friday."
