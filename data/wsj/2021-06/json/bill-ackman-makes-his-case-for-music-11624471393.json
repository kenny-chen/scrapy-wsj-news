    "body": "Hedge-fund billionaire William Ackman says music comes just under food and water in the hierarchy of needs, but music is worth an investment because it pays royalties.<br />In a presentation Wednesday to lay out his rationale for spending $4 billion to purchase 10% of Universal Music Group, Mr. Ackman and his colleagues at  Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd.  spelled out a bullish case for the music industry that relies heavily on the growth potential for music streaming around the globe. He also said music is the least expensive form of entertainment—60 million songs that can be heard anywhere by anyone while doing anything.<br />Over a two-hour webcast, Mr. Ackman pronounced music a better streaming business than video, drew comparisons to the software industry and held up Universal chief executive Lucian Grainge among the greatest CEOs of all time, akin to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs.<br />“If you own UMG you own a royalty on people listening to music,” Mr. Ackman said, noting that Universal’s ownership of one-third of all recorded music gives it leverage in the streaming market. “I can’t think of an asset I’m more confident in being consumed over time.”<br />Pershing executives said the firm would have bought an even larger stake in Universal, even half the company, but Univeral’s parent, French media conglomerate Vivendi SE, which is spinning off Universal Music Group this fall, had tax reasons for limiting the stake size."
