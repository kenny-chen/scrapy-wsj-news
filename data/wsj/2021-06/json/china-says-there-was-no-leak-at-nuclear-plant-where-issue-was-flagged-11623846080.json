    "body": "The Chinese government said there was no leak at the Taishan nuclear power plant despite increased levels of radioactivity, after a buildup of gases raised safety concerns in recent days.<br />Levels of radiation in the environment around the plant in southern China weren’t abnormal, indicating that no leak had occurred, China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment said Wednesday.<br />Over the weekend, French power giant  Électricité de France SA  requested a meeting with Chinese managers of the Taishan plant, which it co-owns, to get more information about the buildup of gases inside one of the plant’s reactors. U.S. officials were also monitoring the potential for actions at the plant in Guangdong province, about 80 miles west of Hong Kong.<br />Earlier, authorities in Hong Kong and China said there had been no radioactive incidents threatening public safety or the environment. EDF said that according to available data, the plant was operating within safety parameters.<br />The increased radioactivity levels were mainly related to broken fuel rods, China’s ecology ministry said, adding that a small amount of breakage due to manufacturing, transportation and loading was unavoidable."
