    "body": "Regarding Peggy Noonan’s “Why We Can’t Move On From Jan. 6” (Declarations, June 12): Most of the country outside of Washington and New York moved on months ago. It isn’t that those events weren’t significant, but her barely disguised politicized dwelling on them serves only to exacerbate an issue which the majority of Americans have processed and are done with.<br />John Ferrell<br />Sausalito, Calif.<br /><br />Count me as one of many millions of Americans who are worried about U.S. democracy, but not because of Jan. 6. Mayhem at the Capitol that day was disturbing, but the insurrectionists weren’t about to bring down the government. We who are not woke still awakened on Jan. 7 expecting to see democratic business as usual, for better or worse. Despite all the media hype and Democratic Party hyperventilation, the only person shot and killed on Jan. 6 was a protester, an unarmed woman who was an Air Force veteran."
