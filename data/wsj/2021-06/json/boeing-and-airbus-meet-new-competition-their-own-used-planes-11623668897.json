    "body": "It is hard to compete against your own products.<br />Vaccination campaigns are finally giving airlines the visibility they need to buy jets again. This is of particular relief to  Boeing ,  which back in July had about 100 of its 737 MAX planes in storage without an owner. Now the number is only about 10, thanks to a wave of orders from major carriers like United Airlines and Alaska Airlines.<br />It confirms one of the cornerstones of aviation economics: There are always buyers of new, more efficient aircraft. With fuel accounting for a third of airlines’ operating expenses, the cost of the latest jets is small compared with the savings they provide.<br />The question is at what price. Carriers’ haste to purchase the MAX suggests that Boeing is offering generous discounts. Irish low-cost carrier  Ryanair ,  which is known for scooping up cheap planes at moments of crisis, ordered 75 units last December.<br />The MAX’s tarnished reputation gives Boeing a particular reason to prioritize sales over margins. But a broader factor also is at play, including for European manufacturer  Airbus : It is extremely cheap to buy their planes—particularly bigger models—in the secondhand market."
