    "body": "Private-equity firms KKR & Co. and Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC agreed to buy  Cloudera Inc.  for roughly $5.3 billion in a deal that would take the software company private.<br />The pair on Tuesday said they would pay $16 a share for the data-cloud company, representing a roughly 24% premium to where the shares closed Friday.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the firms were close to a deal.<br />Founded in 2008 by a group of engineers from  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google,  Facebook Inc.,   Oracle Corp.  and Yahoo Inc., Cloudera was an early player in the open-source software framework Hadoop, which enables large amounts of data to be processed quickly. But it struggled to shift to the now-dominant public cloud, where it faces steep competition from much larger firms including  Amazon.com Inc.’s  Amazon Web Services.<br />Cloudera’s shares have had a rocky run since their public-market debut in 2017. They are trading below their initial public offering price and are down roughly 8% this year."
