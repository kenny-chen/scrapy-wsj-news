    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration said on Tuesday it will give asylum-seeking migrants sent to Mexico by the Trump administration another chance to make their claims in the U.S.<br />Beginning on Wednesday, migrants who lost their asylum cases under the Trump administration’s Remain in Mexico program will have a chance to apply to enter the U.S. and reopen their cases. The Biden administration began winding down the program soon after it took office, calling it inhumane.<br />The population of people eligible to reopen their cases could exceed 30,000, according to government data. Migrants would need to apply to re-enter the U.S. through a website maintained by the U.N. refugee agency.<br />In 2019, the Trump administration began sending migrants seeking asylum to Mexico amid a historic surge of migrant families crossing the border illegally.<br />The Remain in Mexico program, Trump administration officials said, was designed to eliminate the incentive to seek work in the U.S. while migrants waited for their immigration cases to be heard—a process that can take several years."
