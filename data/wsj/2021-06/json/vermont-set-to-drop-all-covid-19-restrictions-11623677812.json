    "body": "FAIRFAX, Vt.—Last week a group of older people who attend Rev. Elizabeth Griffin’s strength training class in a former church did something that felt radical. They had class without their masks.<br />Since the entire group was vaccinated, they could leave the masks home under new town rules.<br />“It’s hard to believe some people are still resistant to the vaccine,” said Colleen Steen, dressed in a pink workout top and celebrating her 75th birthday with hand-held weights and some deep knee bends.<br />As the most vaccinated state in America, Vermont says that nearly 80% of the state’s eligible population has received at least one shot of the vaccine. The state has eased most Covid-19 restrictions, and the few that remain apply to unvaccinated individuals. Officials are expected to lift all remaining rules in the coming days when Vermont reaches that 80% milestone. Cases, as measured by a seven-day average daily case count, have dropped 94% since April 1. Hospitalizations have dropped in half in two weeks, and just one patient has died of Covid-19 in the past three weeks. Hospitals are closing their Covid-19 wards, schools are hosting in-person graduation ceremonies and the tourism industry is experiencing a resurgence.<br />“When we reach the 80% level, that essentially tells Vermonters their life is really going to be much closer to what they considered normal in pre-pandemic,” said Mark Levine, the state’s health commissioner."
