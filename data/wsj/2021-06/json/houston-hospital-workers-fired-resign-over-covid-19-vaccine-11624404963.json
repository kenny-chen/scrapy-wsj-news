    "body": "More than 150 employees at a Houston hospital system who refused to get a Covid-19 vaccine have been fired or resigned after a judge dismissed an employee lawsuit over the vaccine requirement.<br />A spokesperson for Houston Methodist Hospital system said 153 employees either resigned in the two-week suspension period or were terminated on Tuesday.<br />Earlier this month, a federal judge threw out the lawsuit filed by 117 employees over the requirement.<br />The case over how far healthcare institutions can go to protect patients and others against the coronavirus has been closely watched. It is believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.<br />In the June 12 ruling, U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes of Houston deemed lead plaintiff Jennifer Bridges’ contention that the vaccines are “experimental and dangerous” to be false and otherwise irrelevant. He also found that her likening the vaccination requirement to the Nazis’ forced medical experimentation on concentration camp captives during the Holocaust to be “reprehensible.”"
