    "body": "Microsoft Corp.  Chief Executive Satya Nadella will also assume the role of company chairman, the company said Wednesday.<br />The move marks the second year in a row Microsoft’s board has undergone significant change after co-founder Bill Gates last year announced he was stepping down three months after having been re-elected to the board.<br />Mr. Nadella, 53 years old, took over as Microsoft CEO in 2014 and helped restore the software company’s fortunes, in part by betting on the company’s cloud-computing business that has seen strong growth.<br />He turned Microsoft into America’s second-largest company by value after Apple Inc. Microsoft now has a market value of topping $1.9 trillion.<br />John W. Thompson, who preceded Mr. Nadella as chairman, returned to his role as lead independent director, a title he held from 2012 to 2014. He most recently served as the CEO of Virtual Instruments Corp."
