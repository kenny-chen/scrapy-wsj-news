Officials said in March that foreign spectators wouldn’t be permitted to travel to Japan to attend the Olympics.<br />Guidelines released by the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo organizers said venues could be filled up to 50% capacity, with a maximum of 10,000 spectators at each event. Plans could change if infections in Japan rise sharply, they said.<br />“If the situation becomes very dire, we would have to hold the Games without spectators,” Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said.<br />Tokyo has picked up the pace of vaccinations and rolled out strict anti-coronavirus guidelines for people taking part in the Games.
