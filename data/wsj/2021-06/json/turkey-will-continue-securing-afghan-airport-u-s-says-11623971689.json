    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. and Turkey have agreed to a plan for the Turks to continue providing security at the airport in Kabul, U.S. officials said, ensuring the U.S. and other nations can maintain a diplomatic presence in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of troops, expected by next month.<br />Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters Thursday that both sides had made a “clear commitment” on the security of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.<br />“We are feeling good about where we are in terms of the planning with the Turks on this issue,” Mr. Sullivan said.<br />The issue of airport security is critical to the American diplomatic presence in Afghanistan. A Taliban takeover of the airport could make it impossible for American and allied personnel to safely evacuate the country. U.S. military officials also have said that without a secure airport, the U.S. embassy complex in Kabul would have to shut down and all personnel be removed from the country.<br />Taliban leaders already have expressed opposition to any foreign personnel, including from Turkey, remaining in the country to provide airport security."
