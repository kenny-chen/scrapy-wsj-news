    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House on Monday approved its version of a legislative package aimed at boosting U.S. scientific competitiveness to keep pace with China, setting the stage for final negotiations with the Senate, which passed its own $250 billion bill earlier this month.<br />The House approved the main piece of its package by a vote of 345-67. That bill, known as the National Science Foundation for the Future Act, provides major increases for federally-funded science and technology research, and establishes a new division within the NSF for advanced technologies and other cutting-edge research.<br />The House also approved a companion bill to boost research funding at the Energy Department by a vote of 351-68.<br />In a statement, President Biden praised the package as a significant step forward in U.S. efforts to maintain the nation’s economic advantage in the face of emerging threats from China and other countries.<br />“These pieces of legislation…show the American people, and the world, that we’re capable of coming together as a country and setting aside our differences to make transformational investments that will strengthen us both at home and abroad,” the president said. “My administration looks forward to continuing to work with the House and the Senate in producing a final bill I can sign.”"
