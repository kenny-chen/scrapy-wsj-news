    "body": "HONG KONG—China is falling behind the U.S. in global esteem, continuing to hover near all-time lows, despite improved marks for its handling of the pandemic, a new poll in 17 advanced economies found.<br />Asked which country they would prefer closer economic ties with, a growing majority of respondents across the populations named the U.S. over China, the survey by the Pew Research Center found. That reflects a rebound in America’s global image since the Trump administration gave way to the Biden administration, Pew found in another poll published in early June.<br />The findings of the survey of 18,850 people on four continents about China’s image, conducted from February to May, suggest that Beijing’s aggressive diplomacy abroad and authoritarian policies at home are shaping negative perceptions.<br />As China’s Communist Party prepares to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding on Thursday, the country is viewed unfavorably by around three-quarters or more of the people polled in Japan, Sweden, Australia, South Korea and the U.S., according to Pew.<br />Perceptions of China plummeted last year, partly driven by what a majority of respondents said was Beijing’s mishandling of the pandemic. This year, roughly half of respondents said China handled it well."
