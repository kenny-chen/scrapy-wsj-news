    "body": "The Supreme Court is in the home stretch of an unusual term in which it heard all its cases by teleconference because of the pandemic and welcomed a new member, Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed just before the 2020 presidential election. The justices have decided several notable cases already and will issue a wave of rulings in the next few weeks before a summer break. Here are some highlights from the docket.<br />California v. Texas<br />The court for the third time will decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 healthcare overhaul. Republican state attorneys general mounted a new challenge to the law after Congress in 2017 removed the financial penalty for not carrying health insurance. The court previously upheld the insurance mandate under Congress’s taxing power, but what happens now that there is no tax? And if the mandate is void, what happens to the rest of the law?<br />Fulton v. Philadelphia<br />This case examines the legality of the city of Philadelphia’s decision to suspend a Catholic organization from a government-funded foster-care program because it wouldn’t work with same-sex couples. The court is considering whether to revisit past precedent that rejected religious claims for exemption from general laws."
