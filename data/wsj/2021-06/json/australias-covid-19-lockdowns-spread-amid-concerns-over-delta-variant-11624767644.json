    "body": "SYDNEY—More parts of Australia have been locked down as authorities try to locate workers from a remote gold mine linked to five Covid-19 cases thought to be of the highly infectious Delta strain.<br />The far north city of Darwin and two nearby areas were locked down on Sunday for 48 hours after officials failed to locate 15 of 211 workers who flew into Darwin from the Granites Mine in central Australia. The Northern Territory, which covers 548,000 square miles of mostly desert, reported four new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, all linked to a worker previously identified as positive.<br />“The safest thing to do is to assume the worst, assume they are positive and assume there are exposure sites,” Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said.<br />Mr. Gunner said all cases at the mine, which is about 330 miles north of iconic Uluru, were highly likely to be of the Delta variant. He said the outbreak represented the biggest threat to his region since the pandemic began.<br />The first Covid-19 case from the mine was diagnosed on Saturday. About 750 workers are in isolation on site, while about 900 workers have dispersed across the territory and into neighboring Queensland and Western Australia states."
