    "body": "A prominent Harvard drug researcher on Thursday became the third member of a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee to resign over the agency’s decision to approve a drug for Alzheimer’s, questioning whether the drug works.<br />Harvard Medical School professor Aaron S. Kesselheim called the FDA’s approval of the  Biogen Inc.  drug Aduhelm “probably the worst drug approval decision in recent U.S. history.”<br />The outside advisory committee that he served on—the FDA’s panel on peripheral and central nervous-system pharmaceuticals—had rejected supporting the drug, known generically as aducanumab, saying the company needed to conduct further study.<br />Early this week, David S. Knopman, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic, and Joel S. Perlmutter, a neurologist at Washington University in St. Louis, resigned from the advisory committee in protest over the FDA decision. The recommendations of advisory panels, which consist of acknowledged experts in their fields, are generally accepted by the FDA.<br />Dr. Perlmutter said in his resignation letter to Stat, a health news organization, that he was quitting “due to this ruling by the FDA without further discussion with our advisory committee.”"
