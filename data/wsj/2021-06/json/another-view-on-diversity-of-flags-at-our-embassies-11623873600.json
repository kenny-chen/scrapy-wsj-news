    "body": "Two retired foreign service officers, Dave Seminara (“Diplomats Abase America,” op-ed, June 1) and David F. Rogus (Letters, June 9), attack recent instructions from the State Department to American embassies permitting the display of BLM and gay-pride flags. I don’t know where these gentlemen served or when but I was a foreign service officer for 34 years, including two assignments as ambassador. My overseas service was in Africa and Western Europe between 1970 and 2004. Over the course of that time I found that the very idea of America was a tremendous asset to our diplomacy. By that I mean the success of our political system, our economic success, our capacity for innovation and the attraction of our culture. Just as much of an asset was our capacity for openly acknowledging our failures and shortcomings as well as our efforts to address them. No American was more admired than Martin Luther King Jr. Our interests are best served when we continue that tradition, and these flags are part of that.<br />Peter Chaveas<br />Brevard, N.C."
