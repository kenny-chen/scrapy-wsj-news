    "body": "Biogen ’s  Alzheimer’s treatment has reached the market. And all of a sudden, a plodding value stock has a compelling growth story.<br />U.S. regulators gave the green light to the drug known as aducanumab, the first such approval of any drug that promises to slow the progression of the fatal disease. Millions of patients world-wide potentially stand to benefit.<br />Accordingly, Wall Street thinks Biogen has a blockbuster on its hands. While the company has said to expect a slow rollout at first, analysts estimate about $10 billion in annual sales later this decade at its peak. Biogen shares surged 38% on Monday, and a broad biotech index gained nearly 5% on the day.<br />For Biogen, that prospective growth is badly needed: The company expects to book roughly $10.6 billion in total revenue this year. Sales of its top-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera are falling as generic competition comes online in the U.S.<br />There are reasons to be skeptical that aducanumab can ever meet analysts’ lofty expectations. For starters, patients will require testing before receiving the drug that can result in hefty out-of-pocket costs for patients insured by Medicare."
