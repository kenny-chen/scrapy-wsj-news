    "body": "<br />Summer means getting outdoors: swimming, camping, hiking; beach days and baseball games. But it also can mean long car rides, airplane trips, hot afternoons in a shady spot or even (sad to say) a rainy weekend indoors. Family summertime is richer (and more relaxing) when there are good books at hand for kids of every age. Below are 17 selections, from our Children’s Books columnist Meghan Cox Gurdon, that will enhance the season for toddlers, teens and everybody in between. Pack them in a beach bag or knapsack—or produce one or more as a surprise to make a journey shorter and a holiday sweeter.<br />Jun Ichihara and Kazuo Hiraki, “Moimoi—Look at Me!” (The Experiment, 24 pages, $7.95)<br />“Researchers in Japan believe they’ve found a way to understand infant preferences, and the result is a board book full of delicious colors and paisley-like shapes.” (Ages 0 to 2) Read the review<br />Lou Peacock and Nicola Slater, “Charlie Chooses” (Nosy Crow, 32 pages, $16.99)"
