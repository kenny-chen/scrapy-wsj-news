    "body": "HONG KONG—Private companies are racing to bolster sluggish demand for coronavirus vaccines by offering people giveaways and prizes such as a million-dollar apartment, shopping vouchers and a private airplane party.<br />In the past week, corporate initiatives have been announced almost every few hours, with some companies extending cash bonuses, share giveaways and extra time off. The city’s Disneyland theme park, which has been battered by sinking tourism, is giving out goody bags with about $30 of swag and vouchers for guests who have gotten at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine.<br />Private businesses are stepping in with the blessing of city officials, who have spurned calls to themselves offer U.S.-style lotteries, cash handouts or other benefits for vaccinated people. Instead, the government is looking at ways to ease socializing and travel for those who have received the injections. Fully vaccinated people still need to quarantine in hotels for at least two weeks upon return to the city from most locations.<br />The array of corporate offerings has spurred a jump in vaccination sign-ups, though nowhere near the rate officials would like in an effort to reach herd immunity. Close to 1.5 million people in the city of 7.5 million have had both doses of either vaccine available in Hong Kong. The portion of people who have had at least one dose in Singapore, another Asian financial center with a slightly smaller population, is more than twice that.<br />Officials have warned that reserves of Comirnaty, the vaccine co-developed by  BioNTech SE  and  Pfizer Inc.  that is the more popular choice in Hong Kong, will expire in a few months if residents don’t use up the hundreds of thousands of doses in storage. People can also choose CoronaVac from China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd."
