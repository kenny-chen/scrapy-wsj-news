    "body": "Brazil’s central bank, the first among major economies to raise interest rates since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, increased them again on Wednesday, as rising inflation and a slow pace of vaccinations threaten economic recovery.<br />The move by 0.75 percentage point, as expected, was the third in a row, lifting the Selic benchmark lending rate to 4.25% from a historic low of 2% set last year to shore up the economy during the pandemic.<br />Brazil’s monetary authority said more rate increases are likely. Many economists say such measures are necessary to ensure inflation doesn’t get out of hand, as it often has in the past.<br />“The bank had to react and tighten monetary policy to avoid losing control over inflation,” said Pedro Paulo Silveira, an economist at brokerage firm Nova Futura Investimentos.<br />Mr. Silveira noted the bank changed its communication to indicate the intention to move monetary policy to “normal” levels, from the softer stance adopted during the pandemic."
