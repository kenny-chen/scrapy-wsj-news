    "body": "General Motors Co.  is raising its investment in electric vehicles—the second boost in recent months—and pushing deeper into battery production, making it the latest global auto maker to accelerate its transition to plug-in cars.<br />The company also raised its guidance for pretax profit excluding one-time items for the first half of this year, to between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion, compared with its prior forecast of $5.5 billion. GM attributed the improved outlook to continued strength in the U.S. vehicle market and progress combating the semiconductor shortage that has stymied global vehicle production this year.<br />GM said Wednesday that it will spend $35 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, about 30% higher than a target set last November. The increase reflects plans to add two more battery factories in the U.S., joining a plant under construction in Ohio and another slated for Tennessee.<br />Chief Executive Mary Barra said GM is moving faster because the company perceives momentum building for electric-vehicle adoption in the U.S. and has seen a positive response to the future models it has shown.<br />GM and other car companies have been steadily raising their bets on electric cars in the face of stiffening tailpipe-emissions regulations globally. The moves, which at times seem like dueling declarations, also have attracted investors eager to tap the growth potential of battery-powered vehicles."
