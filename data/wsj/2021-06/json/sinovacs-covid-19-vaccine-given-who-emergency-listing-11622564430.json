    "body": "GENEVA—The World Health Organization called Tuesday for $50 billion in funding from wealthy nations to buy vaccine doses for developing countries, saying that “countless lives” and trillions of dollars in economic activity hang in the balance.<br />The WHO also endorsed a second Chinese vaccine against Covid-19, CoronaVac, a shot by private pharmaceutical firm Sinovac BioTech Ltd. for emergency use. The decision paves the way for a WHO-backed Covax vaccine pool to distribute doses. The moves are part of a renewed push by the United Nations to get more vaccines to the developing world to bring global contagion under control.<br />They came a day after the agency ended an annual meeting with some of its other efforts—such as research into the origins of the disease or a new treaty to stop future pandemics—snagged by disagreements between the U.S. and China.<br />Joined by leaders of the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus asked that wealthy countries donate $50 billion that he said would be enough to have 60% of the world-wide population covered within the next year. That, leaders of the four institutions said, would allow $9 trillion in new economic growth by 2025.<br />“It is now crucial to get these lifesaving tools to the people who need them quickly,” Dr. Tedros told reporters. “We have the means to end this pandemic quickly and save countless lives and livelihoods, but we need the will to make it happen.”"
