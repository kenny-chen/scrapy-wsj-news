    "body": "Amid a nationwide crime surge, Democrats may or may not want to support American policing. But at least they want to appear to support  it, and perhaps that’s a start.<br />Tarini Parti and Eliza Collins report today for the Journal:<br />Of course what’s needed is not just funding, but also political leadership that opposes lawlessness and does not seek to use the actions of a particular officer as a pretext to attack cops in general and advance ideological agendas. The Journal report continues:<br />Yes, the Biden administration still wants to blame the homicide surge on the coronavirus rather than on the tolerance among Democrats for last year’s violent riots, the destructive and influential leftist mantra to “defund the police” or ill-conceived policies preventing even good cops from maintaining public safety. But the new White House message is another acknowledgment of what many liberal local politicians have already implicitly admitted and voters of both parties understand: defunding is deadly. According to the Journal account:<br />An explicit Biden endorsement for channeling urban Covid aid into crime-fighting is also an acknowledgment that the pandemic emergency really is over. Now that there is bipartisan agreement on this question, lawmakers should act quickly to end other spending programs that were approved in March but are now obsolete in June."
