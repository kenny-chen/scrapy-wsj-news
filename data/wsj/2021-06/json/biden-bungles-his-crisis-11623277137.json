    "body": "Joe Biden was Barack Obama’s vice president-elect in 2008 when future White House colleague Rahm Emanuel posited what became a truism of Democratic politics: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that [is] it’s an opportunity to do things that you think you could not before.”<br />On the other hand: A crisis is a terrible thing to bungle.<br />With the Covid pandemic, President Biden got his crisis. It is an understatement for the ages to say he has used this crisis to do things no Democrat has attempted in more than 50 years.<br />The questions are everywhere this week: Has Mr. Biden wasted his crisis? Are the Democrats on course to lose the House next year (and not beyond imagining, the Senate)? Is the Biden agenda disappearing up the flue of Joe Manchin’s chimney?<br />My short answers are yes, yes and yes."
