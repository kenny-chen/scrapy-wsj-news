    "body": "SYDNEY—Production at  JBS SA  meat-processing plants in Australia is coming back online faster than authorities had expected after the ransomware attack on the company this week, the country’s agriculture minister said Thursday.<br />Authorities hope the plants will be operating at close to full production rates by early next week, with those in the north of the country likely to be the last to ramp up, said David Littleproud, Australia’s agriculture minister.<br />“We are looking as though we’ve got a good trajectory to get there,” he said. “Obviously, there’s still a lot of variables.”<br />Andre Nogueira, chief executive of JBS’s U.S. operations, said on Wednesday that most of the company’s beef facilities in Australia and the U.S. had resumed work.<br />The attack on JBS this week forced offline plants that account for roughly a quarter of Australia’s red-meat processing. In the U.S., plants that process nearly a quarter of beef and a fifth of pork production were disrupted, pushing up wholesale meat prices while complicating livestock deliveries from farms."
