    "body": "Tuesday<br />U.S. existing-home sales fell in April from the prior month as record-high prices deterred potential buyers. But April sales remained 51.7% higher than the same month a year before. Economists expect another decline in May.<br />Thursday<br />Germany’s leading measure of business confidence, compiled by the Ifo research institute, is expected to record another pickup in optimism in June. That would underpin expectations that Europe’s largest economy has rebounded in the second quarter from a first-quarter contraction and is set for even more rapid growth in the three months through September.<br />U.S. orders for long-last manufactured goods slipped in April for the first time in a year, in part due to auto-industry backlogs caused by the global computer-chip shortage. Economists expect a pickup in May."
