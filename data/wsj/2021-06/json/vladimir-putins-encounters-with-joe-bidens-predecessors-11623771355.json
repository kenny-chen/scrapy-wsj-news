    "body": "President Biden on Monday described Russia President Vladimir Putin as bright, tough and “a worthy adversary.” The two have met before, when Mr. Biden was vice president, and when they meet again on Wednesday in Geneva, he will be the fifth U.S. president to sit across from Mr. Putin on the world stage. Here is how the meetings went with the previous four:<br />President Clinton was Mr. Putin’s first U.S. leader. The two met just months after Mr. Putin was elected president and less than a year before Mr. Clinton left office. The Russian leader appeared aloof with Mr. Clinton, whom he clearly considered to be a lame duck, said James Collins, U.S. ambassador at the time.<br />The leaders, who never got to talking on a first-name basis, agreed that emerging nuclear powers such as North Korea were a growing threat, but Mr. Clinton failed to persuade Mr. Putin to accept a U.S. antimissile system to counter it. At the press conference, Mr. Putin tersely called the U.S. plan “a cure which is worse than the disease.”<br />Mr. Clinton called Mr. Putin “a person who is a very comfortable and pleasant partner in negotiation.”<br />President Bush invested heavily in his relationship with Mr. Putin, and over the course of his presidency he met or talked with Mr. Putin more than any U.S. leader had spoken with a Kremlin counterpart in the past, said Tom Graham, former Russia adviser to Mr. Bush at the National Security Council."
