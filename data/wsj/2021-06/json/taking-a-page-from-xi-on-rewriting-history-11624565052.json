    "body": "Regarding “China Repackages History in Support of Xi’s Vision” (Page One, June 16): What is different about the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts and similar efforts here by leftist news outlets cheered on by corrupt academia and liberal politicians? Fortunately, both efforts are mostly incoherent, easily disputed and not supported with valid evidence and actual facts.<br />Bruce D. Woods<br />Seneca, S.C.<br /><br />Thank you for a thorough article on the Chinese government’s push to scrub any unflattering truth out of its history books and its citizens’ minds. I can only hope our representatives take this to heart for the sake of our democracy. If not, we may find ourselves beyond the looking glass, where there are facts and “alternative facts,” and insurrectionists morph into “tourists.”"
