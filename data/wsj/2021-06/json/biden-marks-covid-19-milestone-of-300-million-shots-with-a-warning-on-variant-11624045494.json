    "body": "President Biden said Friday would mark 300 million shots of the Covid-19 vaccine administered in the U.S. in the 150 days since he took office, but warned of a more easily transmissible variant accounting for an increasing number of cases in the U.S.<br />The Delta variant, first identified in India, could soon become the dominant variant in the U.S., health officials have said.<br />“The new variant will leave unvaccinated people even more vulnerable than they are,” said Mr. Biden, who added that he didn’t think the spread of the variant would lead to lockdowns because much of the country will be vaccinated.<br />“The Delta variant can cause more people to die in areas where people have not been vaccinated,” he said.<br />The administration still needs millions more Americans to get vaccinated to reach the president’s goal of 70% of adults receiving one dose by July 4."
