    "body": "When Bruce Springsteen arrived on stage at the St. James Theatre shortly after 8 p.m. Saturday night, it marked more than just the New Jersey rocker’s return to Broadway with his autobiographical, largely one-man show.<br />It marked the long-awaited return of Broadway itself, following an unprecedented 15-month shutdown due to the pandemic.<br />“It’s been a long time coming,” said Mr. Springsteen, seemingly referencing both facts.<br />It was a sentiment echoed by the hundreds of attendees at the sold-out performance. Many took it a step further and said the event signified the true return of New York City, which has come alive in recent weeks with the easing of pandemic restrictions.<br />“Everything is busier and busier. A year ago, it was so sad,” said Corey Hendrickson, an avid, 40-year-old theatergoer who already has tickets for many of the other Broadway shows that are slated to return in the coming months, including “Hadestown” and “The Lion King.”"
