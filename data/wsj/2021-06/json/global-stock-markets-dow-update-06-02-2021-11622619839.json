    "body": "U.S. stock futures paused Wednesday, suggesting that the major indexes would be muted at the opening bell as investors awaited fresh insights on the economic rebound and rising inflation.<br />Futures tied to the broad S&P 500 index wavered between gains and losses. The broad market gauge finished Tuesday roughly flat. Nasdaq-100 futures edged down 0.1% on Wednesday, suggesting that technology stocks may dip at the open.<br />AMC Entertainment Holdings jumped 33% in premarket trading, adding to a 22% rally Tuesday that came as the movie-theater chain said it had sold shares to a hedge fund. Other stocks popular among individual investors were also rallying ahead of the opening bell, with  BlackBerry  up almost 12%.<br />In the broader market, the major indexes are hovering close to all-time highs on the back of unprecedented fiscal and monetary support. They are struggling for traction this month as investors look for fresh data to justify the high valuations already commanded by many stocks. On Tuesday, manufacturing data pointed to an expansion in factory activity driven by demand for goods, but also highlighted growing supply bottlenecks.<br />“It is going to be more and more difficult for markets to surprise to the upside,” said Willem Sels, global chief investment officer at HSBC Private Bank. “The tide that lifted all boats isn’t as strong anymore.”"
