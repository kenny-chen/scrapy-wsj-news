    "body": "If recent history is any indication, there’s a new hack available to National Hockey League teams hoping to make the Stanley Cup Final: Fire your coach.<br />The Montreal Canadiens—who lost the first game of their finals series 5-1 to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday night—have become the third team in as many years to make it to the finals with an interim coach behind the bench after firing the coach mid-season.<br />But Montreal has done it with a twist. The team is currently being run by an assistant coach who is temporarily replacing another interim coach, who took over after the coach it started the season with was fired.<br />The St. Louis Blues pioneered this trend in 2019. They fired Mike Yeo in November of that year, and rallied from dead last in the league in January to win the Stanley Cup behind interim coach Craig Berube. The team rewarded Berube by making him the permanent coach.<br />Later in 2019, the Dallas Stars fired Jim Montgomery for “unprofessional conduct” that was later revealed to be struggles with alcohol. The next summer, at the NHL’s Canadian bubble postseason, the Stars made it all the way to the Final before falling to the Lightning with interim coach Rick Bowness, who also won the permanent gig in the offseason."
