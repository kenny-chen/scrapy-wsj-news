    "body": "Rich Lesser made a career advising CEOs. His own job as chief executive of Boston Consulting Group showed him the job’s complications up close.<br />In his nine years leading BCG, Mr. Lesser, 59 years old, oversaw its transformation. The firm more than doubled in size to 22,000 employees and tripled its revenue by expanding in areas such as digital analytics. Along the way, he and other CEOs found themselves repeatedly thrust into highly charged political debates—from immigration to voting access—once considered outside the realm of business.<br />“The role has broadened so much over my tenure,” Mr. Lesser says. “The CEOs I talk to, these issues are so much more on their minds than they were on the minds of CEOs even five years ago.”<br />Pressure came from all sides. Within BCG, some partners pressed Mr. Lesser to urgently address climate change. Though he says that he personally saw the issue as important, the firm had not made it a priority. “These were partners who were angry at me because they didn’t think I was taking it seriously enough,” he says.<br />The challenge led to change: BCG committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by cutting full-time employees’ travel by 30% by 2025, and has pledged to cut its net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2030. The firm now works with corporate clients on how to reduce emissions inside their companies and from their supply chains."
