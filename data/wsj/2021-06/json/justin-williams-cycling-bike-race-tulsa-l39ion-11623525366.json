    "body": "Over the years, Justin Williams has won plenty of bike races. But none of them felt quite like Friday night’s victory in Tulsa, Okla.<br />In the lead-up to Friday’s competition—part of the “Tulsa Tough” weekend of cycling action—Williams paid a visit the city’s Greenwood neighborhood, the site of “Black Wall Street,” a once-thriving cluster of Black-owned businesses destroyed by a white mob 100 years ago in the atrocity known as the Tulsa Race Massacre.<br />“It was an incredible experience,” Williams told me Saturday. “It was so emotional.”<br />For Williams, a 32-year-old Black cyclist and team owner from Los Angeles trying to widen Black ridership and diversify a predominantly white sport, the visit to Greenwood was a moving reminder of another era of Black business, one that was burned to the ground on May 31, 1921, in a horror which killed as many as 300 people.<br />“I could just feel the heaviness,” Williams said. “What it must have felt like, to have been trying to do something good for your family and your community.”"
