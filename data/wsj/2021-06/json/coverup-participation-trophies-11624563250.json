    "body": "China’s communist dictatorship still won’t let the world investigate whether its Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source of the deadly Covid pandemic. But the regime is openly and aggressively trying to reward the scientists who work there.<br />The Jerusalem Post reports:<br />Yes, the same dictatorship that suppressed information about early Covid cases in late 2019 and silenced the young doctor who attempted to raise an alarm (and subsequently died) now has nothing but the highest praise for the staff of the Wuhan lab. Perhaps this tells us something about the staff of the Wuhan lab.<br />The Jerusalem Post report continues:<br />Nobody ever said communist propaganda has to be clever. The great discoveries of Pasteur and Dr. Montagnier have been so valuable precisely because they were disclosed to the world, allowing scientists everywhere to enhance their understanding of deadly threats."
