    "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to visit the southern border on Friday, the White House said.<br />Ms. Harris will travel to El Paso, Texas, and will be accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, spokeswoman Symone Sanders said.<br />Ms. Harris said in Mexico City earlier this month that she would visit the border, after Republicans criticized her for not traveling to the region amid a surge in migrants seeking to enter the U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, a Republican whose district includes a swath of the border, said that he wanted the vice president to see the crisis firsthand: “We need the administration to finally take this seriously.”<br />White House officials have said Ms. Harris’s role is limited to diplomacy, with departments such as Homeland Security and Health and Human Services in charge of dealing with migrants crossing into the U.S. Other administration officials have visited the border, though Ms. Harris and President Biden haven’t.<br />Asked in an interview with NBC News earlier this month why she hadn’t visited the border, Ms. Harris noted that she also hadn’t been to Europe, another region important to the U.S. She added: “I’m not discounting the importance of the border.”"
