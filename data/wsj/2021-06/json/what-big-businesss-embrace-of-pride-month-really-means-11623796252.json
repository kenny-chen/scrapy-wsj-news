Next we’ll ask, “Are universities right to mandate that their students get vaccinated?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before June 29. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Pride for Me but Not for Thee<br />Considering America’s long history of antiqueer discrimination, the nationwide celebration of Pride Month demonstrates the monumental strides that have been made due to the tireless work of queer activists. Too often, however, companies’ embrace of Pride Month comes off as virtue signaling to attract queer customers rather than a genuine celebration and pledge of action.<br />Take  Disney .  “There’s room for everyone under the rainbow,” it tweeted on June 1. “Happy #PrideMonth!” Meanwhile, on the same day, the company was hit with a sexual-orientation discrimination lawsuit by one of its executives, Joel Hopkins. Alex Hirsch, the creator of Disney’s hit show “Gravity Falls,” also criticized the company for the hypocrisy of its tweet. Calling on his own experience at Disney, Mr. Hirsch suggested scenes with queer representation are cut because Disney doesn’t want to upset its Russian and Chinese sponsors. He alluded to how creatives would be told by Disney executives to “please revise” their queer characters because they weren’t “Disney appropriate.”"
