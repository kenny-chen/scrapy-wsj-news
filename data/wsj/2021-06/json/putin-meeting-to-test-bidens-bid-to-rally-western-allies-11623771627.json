    "body": "President Biden’s first overseas trip in office has focused on demonstrating renewed amity between the U.S. and its allies in the face of autocracies, a show of unity that will be tested during Wednesday’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.<br />On Tuesday, Mr. Biden completed the last of three summits with the U.S.’s staunchest allies, having met with leaders from the Group of Seven wealthy democracies, NATO and the European Union.<br />U.S. officials believe the tour has successfully unified the world’s major democracies against the influence of autocracies like China and Russia. In announcing a deal with the EU on Tuesday to suspend a 17-year dispute over trade subsidies, part of an effort to mend trans-Atlantic relations, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said, “The president routinely says that we are strongest when we work with our friends and allies.”<br />But cracks remain beneath the surface—most significantly, over how hard to press China. That, analysts say, has increased the need for Mr. Biden to stabilize relations with the Kremlin to focus on Beijing.<br />“We should decide where it’s in our mutual interest, in the interest of the world, to cooperate, and see if we can do that. And the areas where we don’t agree, make clear what the red lines are,” Mr. Biden told reporters Monday after a summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
