She wore pajamas and sweats, and ate at different times than her family.<br />She was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in January; by February her weight was 86 pounds, down from around 118 pounds.<br />“I 100% believe the social isolation from the pandemic triggered the eating disorder,” Ms. O’Neill said.<br />Experts across the country who treat eating disorders in adolescents and young adults say they are seeing unprecedented demand for treatment that arose during the pandemic.
