    "body": "‘Do I amuse you?” Joe Pesci’s character said in the 1990 movie “Goodfellas.” Today it’s a question no one needs to ask. The amusement industry keeps growing. Every second of the day or night, tens of thousands of entertainment options are instantly available on screens that are as common as toothbrushes.<br />Sometimes it’s difficult to remember a time when there wasn’t a single thing to watch for seven or eight hours a day. But that was the case during the first decade that television was taking over American life, and no one thought it odd.<br />Before the 1950s there was nary a screen in most U.S. homes. Soon, though, manufacturers of TV sets were frantically shipping units as fast as they could. It was as if people were hypnotized; they couldn’t get enough television.<br />Yet broadcasters assumed that when families went to sleep, so should TV stations. From late at night until after sunrise, there was nothing on the air in most American cities. If you yearned for something to watch, you were out of luck.<br />The television listings in daily newspapers reflected this. Ohio’s Marion Star of May 15, 1954, noted that at 7 a.m. on Channel 6 there was “No Program.” The Indianapolis Star of June 29, 1957, announced the 7 a.m. offerings of Channels 4, 6 and 8 as “Silent.” The Tampa Tribune on May 4, 1958, advised readers that at 6:30 a.m. Channel 13 was “Off the Air,” and that at 6:45 a.m. Channel 8 was featuring “Test Pattern.”"
