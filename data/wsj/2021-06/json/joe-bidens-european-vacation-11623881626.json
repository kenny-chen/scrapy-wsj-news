    "body": "It has been a challenge to navigate through the steady drizzle of media admiration for President Biden’s love-in with the Group of Seven leaders in Europe, but one ga-ga statement, from French President Emmanuel Macron, caught my eye: “I think it’s great to have a U.S. president part of the club, and very willing to cooperate.”<br />The club? What club?<br />The conventional interpretation of Mr. Biden’s trip to Europe is that, contra the ever-belligerent Donald Trump (whom the current president dumped on by name before the global media), the U.S. is rejoining the club of multilateralism, diplo-speak and doing deals, such as the Paris Agreement on climate and the Obama-Biden-European nuclear deal with Iran, or giving the World Health Organization a redo on its noninvestigation of the coronavirus’s origin.<br />Still, I don’t think this explains what the discerning Mr. Macron meant by welcoming Joe Biden to the “club.”<br />The club Mr. Biden is joining—for all of us back home—is one the U.S. has stayed out of since World War II. That is the club known as the European welfare state."
