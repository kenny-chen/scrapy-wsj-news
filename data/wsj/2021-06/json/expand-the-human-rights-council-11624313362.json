Good luck with that.<br />The 47-nation council was created in 2006 to remedy the defects of its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, once infamously chaired by Moammar Gadhafi’s Libya. The council promised to uphold “the highest standards” of human rights. But 60% of its current members—including China, Cuba, Eritrea, Pakistan, Russia and Venezuela—fail to meet even minimal standards.<br />The problem is the election process. Regional groups divvy up slots in backroom deals, and democracies rarely put up a fight.<br />For tyrannical regimes, winning a world human-rights post constitutes a stamp of legitimacy. “Despite the imperial lies and hoaxes, the world recognizes Cuba, admires and respects it for its firm convictions,” said President Miguel Díaz-Canel after Havana’s victory. Moscow hailed the world’s “wide recognition” of “the correct course being pursued by Russia” on human rights."
