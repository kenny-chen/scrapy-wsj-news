    "body": "Sheldon Whitehouse is making it his life’s work to harass the Supreme Court, and now he wants to track where the Justices travel and why. That’s the essence of the Rhode Island Democrat’s letter this month requesting detailed information about the Supreme Court Justices’ movements.<br />The letter was addressed to Attorney General Merrick Garland and the director of the U.S. Marshals Service, which provides judicial security. We’re sorry to see the letter was co-signed by Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who is abetting the Whitehouse judicial project in effect if not intent.<br />Among other details, the Senators seek “all documents, including memoranda and correspondence, containing information relating to trips outside of Washington, D.C.” where Justices have had a security detail over the past decade. This includes travel in Maryland and Virginia near the D.C. metro area.<br />The Senators claim this exhaustive request is merely routine congressional oversight regarding Justices’ travel, gifts and other emoluments. No one paying attention believes that. Mr. Whitehouse is famous for threatening the Court over everything from amicus briefs to what groups they belong to.<br />The latter is amusing considering Mr. Whitehouse has recently been in the news for not seeming to know if the tony Rhode Island beach club his family belongs to has any non-white members. It’s hard to keep up with his changing explanations."
