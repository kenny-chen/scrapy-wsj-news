    "body": "LIMA, Peru—Pedro Castillo, a far-left political outsider, was leading the count on Tuesday in Peru’s tight presidential election as markets reeled over investor concerns he could win and boost state control over the country’s market economy.<br />With 96% of the votes counted from Sunday’s race, Mr. Castillo had 50.22% of the votes compared with 49.78% for his right-wing opponent Keiko Fujimori, a difference of 75,000 ballots. About 18 million votes were cast in Sunday’s election.<br />Outstanding votes include those from Peruvians living abroad, which favor Ms. Fujimori, and rural votes, which favor Mr. Castillo. There are also about 250,000 votes that need to be reviewed by electoral courts before being included in the tally, political analysts say. Those ballots were contested by campaigns or had technical issues.<br />Alfredo Torres, head of pollster Ipsos Peru, said most of those votes appear to be from areas where Ms. Fujimori won, suggesting she could narrow the gap.<br />“We don’t know if it will be enough to overtake him…it’s most likely that Castillo stays ahead,” said Mr. Torres. “With luck, we’ll know next week.”"
