    "body": "Regarding “Critical Race Theory Confronts Pythagoras” (Letters, June 16): I was more than a little disappointed to learn that a school-board member couldn’t think of a multicultural objective for chemistry, physics and math. The periodic table on its own is a veritable atlas. Places that elements have been named after include Poland, France, Russia, Germany, Japan, America, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Cyprus, Tennessee, California (and in the case of four separate elements) Ytterby, Sweden. The stories behind why these elements took these names are fascinating as well as important for understanding the complex context of the world we live in today.<br />Ivan Wohner<br />Alexandria, Va."
