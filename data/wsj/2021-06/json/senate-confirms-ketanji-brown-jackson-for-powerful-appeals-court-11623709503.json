    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate on Monday confirmed one of President Biden’s most prominent judicial nominees, Ketanji Brown Jackson, for the appeals-court seat that Merrick Garland long held before becoming attorney general.<br />Judge Jackson, 50, who has served as a federal trial judge in the nation’s capital since 2013, is considered a potential Supreme Court candidate if a vacancy opens up for Mr. Biden, who has pledged to place a Black woman on the high court.<br />The judge, a Harvard law graduate and former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, once represented indigent criminal defendants as a public defender and served as a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which sets sentencing guidelines for federal criminal cases.<br />She was confirmed on a 53-44 vote, mostly along party lines, for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, an influential court with a docket filled with cases challenging government rules and regulations. She will replace Mr. Garland, who served on the court for 24 years.<br />Three current Supreme Court justices served previously on the D.C. Circuit. The appeals court has generally leaned to the left in recent years and has a majority of Democratic appointees."
