    "body": "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a directive to speed up work to develop the military forces to deter China and address Pentagon difficulties in carrying out a years-old strategy that called Beijing a principal threat.<br />The directive, issued Wednesday, is based on the recommendation of a high-level Pentagon task force that identified a “say-do” gap between the Defense Department’s objective to counter Chinese aggression and its efforts to meet that goal, a senior Defense official said.<br />That task force was led by Ely Ratner, a former top aide to President Biden who has been named to serve as the Pentagon’s top official on Asia-Pacific affairs.<br />Many of the task force’s recommendations remain classified, and the Pentagon released few details about its work, which involved a four-month review by senior civilian and military officials.<br />The review comes as a decadeslong military buildup by Beijing gathers momentum, threatening the dominance the U.S. has held in East Asia and the Western Pacific."
