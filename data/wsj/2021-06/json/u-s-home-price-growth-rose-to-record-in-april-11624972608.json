    "body": "Home-price growth climbed to a record high in April, as buyers competed for a limited number of homes for sale.<br />The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 14.6% in the year that ended in April, up from an 13.3% annual rate the prior month. April marked the highest annual rate of price growth since the index began in 1987.<br />Home prices have surged in recent months due to low mortgage-interest rates, which have spurred strong demand, and a continued shortage of homes for sale. Many homes are getting multiple offers and selling above asking price. The home-price surge is widespread around the U.S., affecting buyers and sellers in big cities, suburbs and small towns.<br />The median existing-home sales price in May rose almost 24% from a year earlier, topping $350,000 for the first time, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this month.<br />While the pace of price gains is now faster than during the housing boom in the early 2000s, this market is less prone to a downturn, economists say. Ultra-low mortgage interest rates mean that the typical home buyer’s monthly payment hasn’t risen as rapidly as the typical house price."
