    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) laid out what he would like to see in sweeping elections legislation, aiming to stake out a position he hopes could draw bipartisan support while including provisions each party has long opposed.<br />Mr. Manchin has become the deciding swing vote on his party’s most ambitious agenda items. His proposal, which he has shared with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and other Democrats, reflects support for some core measures of Democrats’ “For the People Act”—which faces a test vote on the Senate floor next week—such as mandating at least 15 days of continuous, early voting and automatic voter registration for anyone with a driver’s license. He also endorsed making Election Day a national holiday and forcing the disclosure of large donations to politically active groups that currently aren’t subject to such disclosure requirements.<br />Republicans at the state and federal level have opposed many of these ideas before. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said that the “For the People Act,” which includes some of Mr. Manchin’s provisions, \"is not about anything other than trying to help the Democrats win elections in perpetuity.”<br />Democrats say restrictive voting laws passed by Republican-dominated state legislatures aim to prevent Democratic and minority-group voters from casting ballots.<br />Mr. Manchin’s plan is at odds with some core features of the Democratic bill, a version of which passed the House in March almost entirely on party lines. Mr. Manchin wants to preserve the ability of states to require voters to verify their identities, while Democratic legislation would greatly loosen voter ID requirements by allowing a voter to sign a statement attesting to his or her identity instead of presenting an identification card."
