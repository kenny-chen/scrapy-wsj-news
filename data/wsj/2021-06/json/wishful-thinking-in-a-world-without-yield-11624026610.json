    "body": "At first glance, the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System, one of the largest pension plans in the U.S., doesn’t sound anything like you or me. It commands $66 billion in net assets, spent $515 million last year on management fees, and has more than 40% of its net assets in exclusive investments like buyout, venture-capital and hedge funds.<br />Yet, at the most basic level, this gigantic retirement plan is just like you and me: It is struggling to raise returns in a low-interest-rate world.<br />That can breed desperation, and wishful thinking, for anyone with a portfolio large or small.<br />“The challenge we all face as investors is that the collapse in interest rates makes achieving historical rates of return very difficult,” says John Skjervem, chief executive of Alan Biller and Associates, an institutional investment consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif. When cash and bonds yield close to zero, “stacking the traditional assets on top of that isn’t enough.”<br />For its part, the Pennsylvania school pension fund, also known as PSERS, for years has pumped billions into hedge funds and private equity. Those strategies purport to be able to thrive even when public markets lag. The giant fund had less than 25% of its assets in publicly traded stocks at last year’s end, even after some of the biggest bull markets in history."
