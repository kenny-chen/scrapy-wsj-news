    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration suspended oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, the latest move in its effort to block plans to begin the first-ever drilling program in the pristine 19-million-acre wilderness.<br />The Interior Department said on Tuesday the program will be on hold until it completes a “comprehensive analysis” under the National Environmental Policy Act.<br />A review, ordered by President Biden on his first day in office, identified what it said were defects in the Trump administration’s final decision to approve new oil leases in the refuge, according to the Interior Department, which added a more thorough analysis could lead to the leases being voided altogether.<br />The department said the approval didn’t properly analyze “a reasonable range” of alternatives for allowing and managing oil development while mitigating environmental harm.<br />The refuge—a remote corner of northeast Alaska that is about the size of South Carolina—is home to polar bears and caribou herds. It has been off limits to drillers, miners and other developers for decades. Mr. Biden has sided with environmentalists who say the area should remain pristine, protected wilderness."
