    "body": "Wall Street is selling a record number of junk bonds meant to finance environmental projects, but many have an important catch: The borrowers don’t guarantee that they will use the money for green purposes.<br />High-yield rated companies including Irish packaging maker  Ardagh Group SA  and U.S. car-parts manufacturer  Dana Inc.  have issued green bonds this year. Some of the borrowers used the cash to repay debt, finance a SPAC deal and for other corporate expenses, promising to spend equivalent sums on sustainability in the future.<br />Many of those bonds also included fine-print warnings that the companies might not fulfill their environmental pledges, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Money managers are so eager to buy green-labeled investment products that they are disregarding the potential risk that the bonds aren’t as green as advertised, bond lawyers and analysts said.<br />“This poses a dilemma for the green-bond investor,” said Henry Shilling, founder of Sustainable Research & Analysis LLC and one of the first credit analysts to focus on green bonds. “You need to account for the risk that you are holding something that, in the end, may turn out not to be green.”<br />The rise of junk-rated green bonds is part of a surge in sustainable investing, as money managers and investment banks race to adapt to changing customer demand. The transformation has raised concerns of “greenwashing,’’ or mislabeling funds or securities as green, and the European Union in March enacted new regulations to curb the practice."
