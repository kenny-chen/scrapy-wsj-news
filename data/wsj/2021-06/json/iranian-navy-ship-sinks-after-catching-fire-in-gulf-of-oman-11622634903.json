    "body": "Iran’s largest navy ship sank early Wednesday in the Gulf of Oman after catching fire, according to Iranian state media, the latest blow to the country’s vital infrastructure and military assets in recent months.<br />The Kharg had been deployed to international waters to participate in a training exercise when it caught fire near the port of Jask, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency said. The fire had started in the engine room, causing parts of the ship to melt and fall into the sea, state news agency IRNA said.<br />Rescue workers tried for 20 hours to extinguish the fire but couldn’t prevent it from spreading, Tasnim said, citing Iran’s navy, which added that all of the nearly 400 crewmembers were evacuated safely from the ship.<br />Other Iranian media outlets broadcast footage from the Gulf of Oman of what they said was the ship burning in the distance.<br />Neither outlet reported details of the cause of the fire. The government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
