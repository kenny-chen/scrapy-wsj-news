    "body": "New York Mets ace Jacob deGrom has made throwing over 100 miles per hour look ordinary this season. But as he blew another 101.4 mph heater past a hopeless batter in the first inning on Monday night, deGrom reminded the world that it is not just speed that is devastating hitters this season.<br />The ball whizzed past the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Josh Rojas for strike three in the place where batters are helpless in 2021: the top of the strike zone.<br />High fastballs are the No. 1 tool pitchers have leaned on to tame batters in a season that is already being defined by a jarring decline in hitting across the majors. Scoring is down. On-base percentage is down. The league is on pace to post its lowest batting average in history. And nearly a quarter of all plate-appearances end in strikeouts.<br />Nothing captures the forces behind the offensive downturn better than high heat—fastballs located in the upper bounds of the strike zone. It turned out to be the perfect pitch to combat the revolution that taught hitters to change their mechanics and swing for the fences. This is the pitchers’ revenge.<br />“The pitchers are smart and they’re going to react—just like hitters reacted,” ESPN analyst Jessica Mendoza said."
