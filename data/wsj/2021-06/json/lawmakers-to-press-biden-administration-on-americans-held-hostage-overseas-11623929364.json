    "body": "WASHINGTON—A pair of lawmakers has formed a working group in Congress to bolster U.S. government efforts to aid Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad.<br />Set to launch Thursday, the Congressional Task Force on American Hostages and Americans Wrongfully Detained Abroad aims to assist the families of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained, to provide resources for fellow lawmakers, and to communicate with the administration on the issue. It is led by Reps. French Hill (R., Ark.) and Ted Deutch (D., Fla.).<br />The task force’s formation “gives us hope that our government and our Congress are doing all they can to bring our loved one and all Americans held abroad home,” said Samar Hamwi and Mouna Kamalmaz, the sister and mother, respectively, of Majd Kamalmaz, a Virginia therapist who has been missing since being stopped at a Syrian checkpoint in 2017.<br />The congressmen expect more colleagues to join the task force, which is meant to formalize existing work among members, following its launch Thursday.<br />Mr. Deutch co-sponsored legislation passed last year intended to strengthen U.S. efforts to return Americans held abroad."
