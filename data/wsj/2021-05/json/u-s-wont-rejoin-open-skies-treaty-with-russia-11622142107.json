    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration has decided not to rejoin the Open Skies agreement with Russia after concluding that Russian violations of the deal and failure to take action to return to compliance undermined the pact, the State Department said Thursday.<br />“Further, Russia’s behavior, including its recent actions with respect to Ukraine, is not that of a partner committed to confidence-building,” a spokeswoman said.<br />A Russian embassy spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />The 1992 Open Skies treaty was intended to lower the risk of conflict by allowing the post-Soviet Russian state and Western nations to conduct unarmed reconnaissance flights over each other’s territory.<br />The treaty came into force in 2002. The Trump administration notified the treaty’s members that the U.S. intended to exit from the pact in May of last year. Thirty-four NATO, other European and former Soviet countries are party to the treaty."
