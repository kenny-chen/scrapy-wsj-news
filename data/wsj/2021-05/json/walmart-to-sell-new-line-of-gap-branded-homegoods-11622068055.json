    "body": "Walmart Inc.  and  Gap Inc.  plan to partner on a line of Gap-branded homegoods that will be sold in Walmart stores, according to people familiar with the situation, a sign of how each retailer is stretching into new territory to stay competitive.<br />The line of home items will be called Gap Home and go on sale later this year, say some of these people.<br />In recent years, Walmart has worked to expand its apparel and homegoods selection to include brands perceived as higher end, part of its efforts to appeal to a wider customer base and boost online sales. The retail behemoth earlier this year named fashion designer Brandon Maxwell as creative director of Free Assembly and Scoop, private-label brands that Walmart says are part of its “elevated fashion brands.” This month, Walmart said it would acquire ZeekIt, which allows digital shoppers to see how clothes might look on their bodies or models with similar bodies.<br />Gap, which has been working to revive its namesake brand, doesn’t currently sell homegoods and has never sold its branded items inside Walmart.<br />Gap signed a deal last year with licensing company IMG that will allow it to expand into home décor, furniture, textiles and other categories. The agreement also includes Gap’s Banana Republic brand."
