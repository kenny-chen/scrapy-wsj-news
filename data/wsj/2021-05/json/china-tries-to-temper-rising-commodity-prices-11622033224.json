    "body": "China is trying to cool red-hot markets for key industrial commodities such as iron ore, seeking to ensure runaway prices for these raw materials don’t hurt the broader post-pandemic recovery.<br />Chinese officials, led by Premier Li Keqiang, have stepped up their rhetoric on natural resources since mid-May. The national cabinet, or State Council, which Mr. Li chairs, said last week it would take steps to ensure adequate supply and stable prices for commodities.<br />On Sunday, six agencies including China’s competition and securities regulators summoned commodity industry representatives to warn them of a zero-tolerance approach to illegal activities like market manipulation, price-gouging and hoarding. Attendees included representatives of industry associations and commodity producers.<br />The government bodies also said they would supervise markets such as those for copper and aluminum more closely, according to a statement Monday from the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic-planning agency.<br />The moves follow a rally, fueled by a global economic rebound and supply-chain disruptions, that has lifted prices for some commodities such as copper to records."
