    "body": "BERLIN—Volvo Cars, the Swedish auto maker owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding, said Wednesday that it is exploring a potential listing on the Nasdaq Stockholm index through an initial public offering.<br />The company also extended Chief Executive Håkan Samuelsson’s contract to the end of 2022. Mr. Samuelsson has long favored a listing, which would cap a decadelong turnaround of the car maker known for its understated Scandinavian design and reputation for safety.<br />Proceeding with the listing in Stockholm would leave the company with a broader shareholder base and greater independence from its Chinese investors. Volvo didn’t say how big a stake it might float.<br />“A potential listing on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange could create an opportunity for global investors to participate in our journey to become a leader in the fast-growing premium and intelligent electric vehicle segment,” Mr. Samuelsson said.<br />Volvo Cars have long discussed a potential listing, but Wednesday’s announcement marks the first concrete step toward going public. The company said whether to go ahead with the offering would depend on market conditions."
