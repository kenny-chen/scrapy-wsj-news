    "body": "The boom in blank-check companies earlier this year has lured companies to list in New York and has cut into Europe’s share of the global market for initial public offerings.<br />Signa Sports United, a Berlin-based sports e-commerce and technology platform, is among the latest looking at this route through a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. It is in talks to merge with  Yucaipa Acquisition Corp.  to go public on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal would include the acquisition of the U.K. online bike retailer Wiggle Chain Reaction Cycles and could value the combined company at up to $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Eleven European companies operating in sectors ranging from packaging to healthcare have announced deals this year to go public through a U.S.-listed SPAC, according to Refinitiv. European exchanges have only attracted four such tie-ups: two in Germany, one in the U.K. and one in Italy.<br />That divide highlights Europe’s competitive disadvantage when it comes to SPACs. The region has a smaller pool of these vehicles looking for targets to take public on a European exchange.<br />SPACs are publicly listed shell companies that raise money to make an acquisition. They offer targets a quicker way to go public than a traditional IPO. Their popularity in the U.S. has outpaced Europe because of more accommodating listing rules in some markets and investors’ greater familiarity with the vehicles."
