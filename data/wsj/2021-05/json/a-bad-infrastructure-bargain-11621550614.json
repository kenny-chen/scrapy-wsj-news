    "body": "Senate Republicans say they’re inching closer to striking an infrastructure deal with the Biden Administration. Sorry to say, this looks like bad policy and politics—bipartisanship for its own sake, and not for the public good.<br />Republicans don’t want to look like obstructionists, and spending more on roads, bridges and ports is politically popular. Maybe a deal that exclusively funds public works and includes some policy victories like permitting reform would be worthwhile. But there’s no evidence that Democrats want that kind of compromise.<br />One question Republicans should consider is how much more infrastructure spending is even needed. Congress has already shovelled out hundreds of billions of dollars for public transit, housing, airports and broadband in the past year.<br />Democrats in March appropriated $30 billion for public transit, which was on top of the $40 billion from last year’s Covid bills, which was on top of the $13 billion Congress annually spends. That’s a total of $83 billion in spending in one year—about six times what Congress normally spends.<br />There’s no doubt that public works in many places have deteriorated, but whose fault is that? State and local governments are primarily responsible for financing and maintaining public works. Yet Democrats who control big cities and blue states prioritize union wages, benefits and inefficient work rules that increase construction and operating costs."
