    "body": "The great unfinished conversation in America is the one about race.<br />And right now, the controversy over Sen. Tim Scott’s declaration that America isn’t a racist country suggests that conversation isn’t close to being finished—in fact, that it may be getting harder rather than easier to resolve.<br />Yet often it takes controversy and debate to reach a clarifying moment, and perhaps that’s where America stands after a year of racial reckoning. If the upshot of the current turn is an agreement that there has been more progress on race than some on the left will acknowledge, but also further to go than some on the right will admit—well, perhaps that will amount to progress.<br />One thing that’s clear is that the terms of the conversation about race have changed, and the changes separate Americans along not just racial lines but generational ones as well. If nothing else, that recognition may help move the conversation along. Semantics aren’t always important, but in this case they are vital.<br />These observations come from talks with people who have thought long and hard about race relations in America, and who are doing so anew amid this new phase of the debate."
