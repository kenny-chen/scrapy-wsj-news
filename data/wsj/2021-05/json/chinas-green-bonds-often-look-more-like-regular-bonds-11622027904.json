    "body": "Chinese companies are issuing green bonds at a record pace, though some analysts say the securities don’t always meet the environmental requirements common in other parts of the world.<br />China, the world’s largest producer of carbon dioxide, has committed to reducing its emissions. To fund the transition, its companies have embraced green bonds, which are typically designed to fund climate-friendly initiatives like switching to alternative energy from fossil fuels.<br />The guidelines for green investments are squishy in many places, and in China’s domestic bond market they are more so. The Chinese market is regulated by several agencies, which apply different rules on the uses of the cash and disclosure. In some cases, up to half of the proceeds from onshore green bonds can be used to fund a business’s day-to-day cash needs instead of climate-related projects. The equivalent international maximum is 5%.<br />“This could increase the risk of greenwashing, where the true environmental benefit of the transaction is overstated,” said Lori Shapiro, a sustainable finance analyst at S&P Global Ratings.<br />Still, the Chinese government has in other ways tightened standards for the use of proceeds from green bonds, for example by vetoing coal-related deals. And investors are lining up to provide capital to help Chinese companies reduce their carbon emissions, just as they are doing in the U.S. and Europe."
