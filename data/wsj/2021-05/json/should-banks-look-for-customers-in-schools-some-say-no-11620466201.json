    "body": "SYDNEY—Rosemary Donald was initially in favor of an Australian bank visiting the suburban Sydney school attended by her three sons. She spent a year volunteering for the program, collecting money from students who wanted an account and processing deposits.<br />Then she began to have doubts.<br />“It’s always sold as a really great numeracy program for the children and to teach them how to save,” said Ms. Donald. “But this is where the kids will end up having their first credit card and their first home loan.”<br />School banking programs, which typically involve a weekly deposit day and an annual visit from the bank and its mascot, are facing a growing backlash in Australia.<br />A recent critical report from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission looked at 10 banks and found they couldn’t show that their school programs helped children to develop long-term saving habits. It faulted the programs for exposing children to sophisticated marketing tactics and said banks didn’t state clearly a key objective was to attract customers."
