    "body": "For much of the pandemic, housebound consumers in the West snapped up goods ranging from personal computers to treadmills. Now, as vaccination campaigns take hold, people are indulging in close-contact services—haircuts, dining out, live music events—that were off limits for so long.<br />That switch back to services is at the center of a high-stakes debate for businesses, economists and policy makers.<br />They must discern whether Western consumers’ new spending on services, in particular travel, entertainment and personal care, will come at the cost of cutting back on spending for goods. The answer has big implications, in particular, for inflation.<br />In a recent survey, business leaders in the eurozone told the European Central Bank that they expect some spending to divert away from consumer goods, a shift that could take the pressure off factories around the world that have strained to meet demand. That demand has created bottlenecks in supply chains, a scramble for raw materials and long delays in shipping—pressures that caused a sharp rise in prices.<br />Others, however, believe that it is unlikely an increase in spending on services as economies reopen will clear those logjams. Indeed, they believe that households have built up so much in savings that they can spend on both goods and services."
