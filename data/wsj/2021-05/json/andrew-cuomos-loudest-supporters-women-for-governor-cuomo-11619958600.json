    "body": "When New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo began facing calls to resign over allegations of sexual harassment, billboard messages, rallies and social-media posts suddenly appeared in support of him.<br />The reason: die-hard Cuomo fans who have joined forces in several Facebook groups to strategize ways to show their support for the governor. One of the biggest is “Women for Governor Cuomo,” a private fan club of about 1,100 members who are mostly women over age 55. One of its members has even earned thanks from the governor for her efforts of support.<br />Some of the women have urged followers in the private group to call state officials, respond to Mr. Cuomo’s accusers and rivals on Twitter, attend rallies and contribute thousands of dollars for pro-Cuomo advertising. Those include banners flown over New York beaches and a billboard ad on a highway in Albany. Others have attacked on social media the former Cuomo aides who have accused him of sexual harassment.<br />Some members said in the group that they were flooding an official hotline that was set up for tipsters by lawyers working for the state Assembly impeachment committee and leaving positive messages about the governor.<br />New York state Assemblyman Charles Lavine, who oversees the chamber’s impeachment probe, declined to comment about messages that investigators have received."
