    "body": "When a former intern at China’s state broadcaster accused one of the country’s best-known TV anchors of sexual harassment in 2018, it energized women’s rights activists in the country, who saw it as a sign the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum in China.<br />But three years later, many supporters of #MeToo say they are pessimistic about the prospects for cases filed by accusers and the willingness of more people to come forward, as some face defamation suits and the former intern, Zhou Xiaoxuan, objects to way the court is handling her lawsuit alleging sexual harassment against CCTV presenter Zhu Jun. Mr. Zhu denies wrongdoing.<br />On Friday, hours before a scheduled hearing in Ms. Zhou’s case, she published a post on China’s  Twitter -like Weibo service saying the court had notified her lawyers that her case would be delayed.<br />It couldn’t be determined why the court delayed the case. The Chinese court system is sometimes opaque and often doesn’t make its processes and reasoning for decisions public. Regardless of the reason, many of her supporters expressed disappointment about the delay.<br />“We don’t know what’s happening,” Ms. Zhou said in an interview, adding that the court hadn’t offered an explanation for the delay or given her a new court date."
