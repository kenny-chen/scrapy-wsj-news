    "body": "Summer vacations are coming back. So are the airline algorithms that know how much you are prepared to pay for them.<br />In the leisure market, domestic air travel is normalizing in terms of both bookings and fares. Crucially, vaccinations are making people start to book further out: Online travel agency Skyscanner estimates an average booking horizon of around 75 days in March, compared with a low of 55 last July.<br />While most businesses charge the same price for the same product, airlines’ secret sauce is so-called price discrimination: selling equivalent seats at different rates to different people. As a result, they don’t just need demand to be stronger, but also somewhat predictable.<br />Because the summer “seasonality” is starting to look more normal, “we will be able to hold our yield-management strategies, especially when we talk about the weekends of the peak periods,” Spirit Airlines Chief Commercial Officer Matt Klein recently told analysts.<br />Traditionally, airlines use two different teams to manage fares. The pricing department sets a range of prices for each trip and cabin type. Responding to demand then mostly falls to the yield- or revenue-management department, which chooses how many tickets of each class to make available. As seats in one fare category fill up, buyers are bumped to the next."
