    "body": "Squarespace Inc.’s  shares made their trading debut Wednesday, falling well below where they were valued during the company’s latest fundraising round, as stocks slipped more broadly.<br />Shares for the website-development company began trading at $48 via a direct listing, a method of going public that bypasses traditional initial public offerings. They fell through the afternoon and closed at $43.65. In a prospectus about the offering, the company had said it raised about $300 million in March by selling stock in a private deal for roughly $68.42 a share.<br />At the end of its first day, the stock market valued Squarespace at roughly $5.9 billion based on roughly 136 million shares outstanding. The stock also spent most of the day below the so-called reference price of $50 set by the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday as a guidepost for trading.<br />U.S. stocks traded lower Wednesday, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all down for the day, though the losses weren’t as bad at the closing bell as they were earlier in the session.<br />Anthony Casalena, founder and chief executive, said that he didn’t try to time the market and that the debut isn’t just about one day."
