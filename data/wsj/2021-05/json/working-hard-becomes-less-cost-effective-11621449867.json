    "body": "Regarding Daniel Henninger’s “Is the Work Ethic Dying?” (Wonder Land, May 13): The work ethic is being strangled by government. Why work when your tax dollars flow to those who don’t? I paid off my student loans for undergraduate and law school, as well as those of my wife so she could raise our children, and I invested in 529 plans so my children wouldn’t have to borrow for college. Now I’m paying off other people’s student loans. I bought real property in the bubble run-up, and was encouraged by lenders and others to take more risk, which I declined. But others took the risk, and I wound up helping to pay their debt. My tax money went to the savings and loan disaster as well. Now my tax money pays people not to work. On the evidence, can you blame people for not working?<br />Martin Connor<br />Bettendorf, Iowa<br /><br />While economists are divided on the efficacy of stimulus policies, one of the main arguments Keynesian economists employ in their favor is “hysteresis”—the idea that recessions, if left unchecked, will leave permanent scars on the economy. People who lose their jobs during a downturn, the theory argues, won’t only experience erosion of skills, but may also experience an adverse change in their attitude toward work. The longer one is unemployed, the more lasting these scars."
