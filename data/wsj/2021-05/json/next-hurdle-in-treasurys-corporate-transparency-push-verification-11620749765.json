    "body": "The U.S. Treasury Department last month kicked off the process of establishing a long-awaited corporate ownership registry. The agency is already facing sharply diverging views on how it should work.<br />Top of mind for financial institutions and other stakeholders is how ownership information that is submitted to the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network will be collected and verified, and who will have access to it.<br />The registry, which experts say could be years in the making, is supposed to help the U.S. crack down on the illicit use of anonymous shell companies. Congress outlined the parameters for the new database in a law passed in January, but it falls on FinCEN to work out the specifics. That includes defining who qualifies as an owner and which companies will be exempt from submitting information.<br />The first step is to write the regulations that will govern the database, a task FinCEN is supposed to complete by January. As part of that process, the agency has received more than 200 letters following an April request for input about those proposed regulations. It will have another two years to put the regulations it writes into effect.<br />A FinCEN spokeswoman said the agency is reviewing the comments it received."
