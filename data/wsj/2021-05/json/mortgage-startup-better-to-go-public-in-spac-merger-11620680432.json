    "body": "Startup mortgage lender Better plans to go public by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Better Holdco Inc. plans to merge with  Aurora Acquisition Corp. , a SPAC sponsored by investment firm Novator Capital, at valuation of roughly $7 billion pre-money, the people said. The transaction could be completed this week.<br />SoftBank Group Corp. , which recently invested $500 million in Better, could put in another $1.3 billion through a PIPE, or private investment in public equity, a common feature of SPAC mergers. (Better might place $400 million of that with other investors.) The remaining $200 million of the $1.5 billion PIPE is to come from Aurora, whose sponsor is the investment vehicle of Icelandic billionaire Thor Bjorgolfsson.<br />There has been an explosion lately in deal activity involving SPACs, which raise money in an initial public offering and then look for a business to combine with, as private companies seek a more streamlined route to the public markets than through a traditional listing.<br />Founded in New York in 2014, Better provides home loans for consumers through its website and banks such as  Ally Financial Inc.  Better had over $850 million in revenue in 2020 and more than $200 million in net profits, according to people familiar with the companyâ€™s finances."
