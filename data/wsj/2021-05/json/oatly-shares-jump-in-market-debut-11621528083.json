    "body": "Swedish oat-milk maker  Oatly Group  AB’s stock climbed 19% in its trading debut on Thursday, a welcome sign for the IPO market.<br />The shares, trading under the symbol OTLY, closed Thursday at $20.20, well above Oatly’s initial-public-offering price of $17, giving the company a valuation of roughly $12 billion. That is a huge step up from just 10 months ago, when Oatly struck a deal to sell a 10% stake to a group of celebrities and  Blackstone Group Inc.  for $200 million, valuing the company at $2 billion.<br />The big jump by Oatly shares, as well as a 31% gain in  Procore Technologies Inc.’s  stock on its first trading day Thursday, bode well for the IPO market. In recent weeks, the market has shown signs of cooling amid a drop in the broader stock market. All three major stock indexes rose Thursday.<br />Many companies that were planning on launching IPOs in June were watching this week’s debuts before deciding whether to go forward with their own offerings, according to several IPO bankers.<br />Last week, at least three companies postponed their IPOs because of stock-market volatility. This week, website-development company  Squarespace Inc.’s  shares made their debut at a level far below their last financing round."
