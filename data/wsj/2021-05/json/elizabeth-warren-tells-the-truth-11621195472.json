    "body": "Progressives are promoting President Biden’s waiver of U.S. Covid vaccine patents as necessary to save lives. So full marks for candor to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who last week explained the real goal: set a precedent that erodes all pharmaceutical intellectual property protections in the U.S. and around the world.<br />“Special [IP] protections for drug companies are an even bigger issue than COVID-19 alone,” the Massachusetts Senator said at a Senate Finance hearing with U.S. Trade Rep Katherine Tai on Wednesday. “I think it’s time now for our trade negotiators to take leadership and actively set rules that lower drug costs for American families.”<br />What special protections? Drug makers receive less IP protection than other businesses under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which allow low-income countries to force drug makers to license patents during emergencies. But progressives believe IP protections shouldn’t exist at all for drugs and that their makers shouldn’t be rewarded for years of risky investment and innovation.<br />As Ms. Warren explained: “We’re fighting over a waiver to [IP] rules—rules that never should have existed in the first place.”<br />Or as Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden put it: Intellectual property rules should “promote the common good,” which will presumably be defined by . . . Ron Wyden."
