    "body": "Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), the former chair of the House Republican Conference, is set to be interviewed Wednesday afternoon at 12:30 p.m. ET at The Wall Street Journal’s Women, Power and Equity event.<br />Ms. Cheney is expected to be asked about how she seeks to lead the party forward in a post-Donald Trump era and the challenges for women navigating in leadership roles.<br />The lawmaker was ousted from GOP leadership earlier this month. She had clashed with senior Republicans by pushing back aggressively and publicly on Mr. Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. Other Republicans said her criticisms of Mr. Trump were hurting party unity.<br />Ms. Cheney has said she would continue to challenge Mr. Trump’s claims and outline a different path for the GOP. She is expected to remain in Congress and run for re-election in Wyoming, where she already faces primary challengers.<br />Also set to be interviewed at the Journal event are Reps. Nicole Malliotakis (R., N.Y.) and Marilyn Strickland (D., Wash.), two of 27 freshmen congresswomen this year. The Journal will also interview Symone Sanders, chief spokesperson and senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris."
