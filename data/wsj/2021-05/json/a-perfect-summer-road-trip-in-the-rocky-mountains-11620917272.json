If you’re pressed for time but eager to gorge on scenic beauty and intriguing mountain towns, we’ve devised a three-day road trip setting out from Denver and ending in Grand Junction. A few pointers: Some of the best spots sit at the end of rocky roads; opt for four-wheel drive. Cellphone reception can’t cross over every peak; make sure your maps are printed or downloaded in advance. This region can be highly seasonal; visit between now and the end of September before some places flip from bustling to boarded-up.<br />Breakfast from Crema Coffee House (cremacoffeehouse.net) fuels the 2-hour-15-minute launch out of Denver’s orbit and into the mountains toward Buena Vista (“BYOO-nuh Vista” if you want to blend in). Along the Arkansas River, the town is a jumping-in point for kayakers, white-water rafters and stand-up paddleboarders (which is why you see so many signs asking you “SUP?”). If the rapids look too rapid, stroll instead along the banks in South Main, a meticulous neighborhood of gabled homes and shops that feels slightly staged but nonetheless stylish. Pop into the bar at the Surf Hotel, which anchors the area, for a refreshment on the wraparound balcony that overlooks the river (surfhotel.com).<br />Bid goodbye to Buena Vista and head south on Highway 285. Turn west toward Mount Princeton Hot Springs Resort for a creekside geothermal soak (mtprinceton.com; day passes available). Next up: the ghost town of St Elmo, a late-1800s mining community that dried up when the railroad did, leaving behind a row of weathered wood structures fit for a Spaghetti Western.<br />Plan to bunk down for the night farther south in Salida at the Amigo Motor Lodge, a chic update of a ’50s roadside motel that brought in a few refurbished Airstream trailers (from $115 a night, stayamigo.com). After checking in, head to the town’s brick-and-mural-lined historic district, stopping for Howl Mercantile and Coffee’s cabin-cozy ceramics (howlmercantile.com) and the Museum of Authenticity, with its exceptional collection of Greek folk art and works by Colorado artists (museumofauthenticity.org).<br />Show no restraint when selecting your breakfast items at Salida’s Little Red Hen Bakery (littleredhensalida.com). The drive west over Monarch Pass offers a panorama of the Sawatch mountain range as you cross the Continental Divide, the boundary that decides whether a river flows east or west. Continue on to Crested Butte, carved with plenty of hiking and biking paths. During the Crested Butte Wildflower Festival, July 9-18, local guides lead walks to the lushest spots, including the Rustler Gulch and Beckwith Pass trails (crestedbuttewildflowerfestival.org). Back in town, brightly painted buildings along Elk Avenue host convivial places such as Secret Stash (secretstash.com), which serves cheeky pizzas like the Booty Call (a heap of meat)."
