Previous coverage and new stories running this week can be found here.<br />First impressions are hard to overcome.<br />That’s true in relationships. And it seems it’s also true with online consumer reviews.<br />A new study published in Marketing Science finds a product’s first online review has a lasting impact—affecting how many reviews it receives and its star rating.<br />Researchers found products with a negative first review (three stars or less) received almost 15 fewer reviews overall at the end of six months than products that received positive reviews, and about 36 fewer reviews at the end of 12 months. A negative first review also reduced a product’s average rating by 0.29 star over a year compared with a positive first review."
