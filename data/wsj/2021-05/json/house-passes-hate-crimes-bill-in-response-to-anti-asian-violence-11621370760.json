    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House easily passed legislation aimed at bolstering the country’s response to hate crimes in the wake of recent violence against Asian-Americans.<br />Already approved by the Senate, the legislation passed the House in a 364-62 vote Tuesday and now heads to the White House for President Biden’s expected signature.<br />The legislation would designate an official at the Justice Department to expedite the review of hate crimes. It also requires the attorney general to issue guidance to state and local law-enforcement agencies on how to establish online reporting for hate crimes, collect data and raise public awareness about such crimes during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />“The past year and a half has been one of pain and struggle, marked by despicable and sickening acts of hate and violence against the Asian American community,” which has been scapegoated for the coronavirus outbreak, said Rep. Grace Meng (D., N.Y.), the bill’s sponsor in the House.<br />The legislation, she told reporters Tuesday, underscores “that the discrimination and violence against those of Asian descent is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.”"
