    "body": "Last spring, 27-year-old Grace DeWitt had a lot of free time when her hours were reduced at the pub she manages. She started watching baking shows, including “The Great British Baking Show” and “Sugar Rush,” and inspiration struck.<br />“I realized that I could do this,” says Ms. DeWitt, of Addison, Texas.<br />She started making basic cakes and cupcakes, then moved on to experimenting with different flavors and textures, such as Strawberry Meringue Buttercream frosting. Now, she says, she bakes a few times a week.<br />The baking industry wants to keep it that way.<br />During the pandemic, people fought stress and boredom by whipping up cookies, breads, cakes and brownies.
