    "body": "When Bernard Ziegler learned to fly in the 1950s, pilots controlled jets via cables and rods powered by hydraulics.<br />By the time he retired as a senior vice president of Airbus in 1997, the former French fighter pilot had helped change the nature of flying airliners into a far more automated process. Electronic signals guide mechanical parts, pilots scan computer screens instead of dials and some of the controls resemble joysticks.<br />The “fly-by-wire” technology Mr. Ziegler championed features software that monitors planes’ movements and can block certain dangerous maneuvers. He likened the digital minders to highway guardrails and insisted that they provided a tremendous leap in air safety.<br />“The pilot flies one way for three years, and then one day he must decide in seconds to do something totally different,” Mr. Ziegler told The Wall Street Journal in 1986. “That’s impossible, and that is why we need automatic systems.” With the fly-by-wire technology pioneered by Airbus, even his concierge eventually would be able to fly a plane, he promised.<br />Mr. Ziegler, an aircraft design engineer and former test pilot, died May 4 at his home near Toulouse, France. He was 88."
