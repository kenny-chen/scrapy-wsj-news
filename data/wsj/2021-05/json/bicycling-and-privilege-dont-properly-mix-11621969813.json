    "body": "Regarding “Notable & Quotable: Bike Privilege” (May 22): I read R. Khalil Saucier’s Bicycling Magazine article “Cycling and the Power of White Privilege.” In it Mr. Saucier asserts the sport is racist because “world-champion Chloe Dygert ‘liked’ several racist and transphobic tweets. One tweet said ‘white privilege doesn’t exist,’ while another suggested that if football player Colin Kaepernick ‘realized that if he grew an afro and played the part of victim, he could scam the Black community out of millions.’”<br />It is disturbing that it is now accepted by many that believing an entire race is privileged isn’t racist, but arguing that an entire race isn’t privileged is racist. If I think this has turned the definition of racism on its head, does that make me a racist?<br />As far as the criticism of Mr. Kaepernick, criticism of controversial public figures is common. If the race of the object of criticism determines if the criticism is allowed, it again turns the meaning of racism on its head.<br />Mr. Saucier’s extrapolation that an entire sport is racist because a prominent figure in it “liked” some posts to which he takes umbrage is sad. It dilutes the meaning of racism to anything anyone doesn’t like to hear, about a subject on which they’ve decided only their view is legitimate.<br />Don Meltzer"
