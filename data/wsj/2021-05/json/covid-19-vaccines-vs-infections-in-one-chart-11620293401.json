    "body": "Since the first Covid-19 vaccines were approved in December, the U.S. has administered nearly 250 million doses, getting shots in the arms of more than four in 10 Americans. About a third of the population is fully vaccinated.<br />Those numbers are far from what experts say is probably necessary to achieve herd immunity, the point at which enough people become immune such that the whole community is protected. And the average daily rate of vaccinations has fallen by almost a third from its peak in mid-April.<br />While those numbers are frustrating efforts to broaden the vaccinated population, the country does appear to have reached a tipping point in passing the 40% mark—a figure that many public-health experts call an important threshold where vaccinations gain an upper hand over the coronavirus.<br />—Joel Eastwood contributed to this article."
