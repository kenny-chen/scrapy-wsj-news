    "body": "U.S. stock futures ticked down Tuesday as investors awaited data that will likely show the trade deficit widened to a fresh record in March.<br />Futures tied to the broad S&P 500 index slid 0.1%. The benchmark advanced 0.3% on Monday, despite declines in giant technology stocks. Futures linked to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 fell 0.3% Tuesday.<br />The major indexes are hovering close to record levels as investors weigh strong economic data and robust corporate earnings against inflation concerns and rising coronavirus cases in parts of the world. Some money managers say brightening prospects for the economy and for businesses’ profits has been baked into stocks’ valuations.<br />“The market has already priced in a strong recovery and earnings season over-delivered, but it was still not enough to drive indexes much higher,” said Sophie Chardon, cross-asset strategist at Lombard Odier. “The market is now focusing on the next steps, especially on policy. The next step will be to see how the Fed shifts its monetary policy outlook.”<br />The improving economic picture is encouraging some investors to step up bets on companies that stand to benefit the most from the recovery. That is leading to a rally in energy and banking stocks, while technology shares have slowed their gains."
