    "body": "Democrats failed to place a candidate in the final round of balloting for a House seat from Texas, leading some in the party to say on Sunday that the Democrats’ national campaign groups should have invested more in competing for a winnable seat.<br />Susan Wright, a GOP activist and the widow of Rep. Ron Wright, was the top vote-winner among 23 candidates in a special election Saturday and will advance to a runoff election to replace her late husband. She will face Rep. Jake Ellzey, also a Republican, who was the second-highest vote-winner.<br />A Democrat, Jana Lynne Sanchez, trailed Mr. Ellzey by about 350 votes, or 0.4 percentage point, and conceded the race.<br />“Democrats have come a long way toward competing in Texas, but we still have a way to go,” Ms. Sanchez, one of 10 Democrats in the race, said in a statement. Ms. Sanchez had run against Mr. Wright in 2018 and lost.<br />The race will go to a runoff because no candidate won over 50% of the vote. That election hasn’t yet been scheduled."
