    "body": "Indian state governments extended lockdown measures and imposed other new restrictions on Friday as authorities attempted to curb a ferocious and fast-moving Covid-19 outbreak that has overwhelmed the country’s healthcare system.<br />Growth in new cases was beginning to slow in some of the hardest-hit parts of India, including the capital, New Delhi, and Maharashtra, home of business and finance hub Mumbai. But other states are still seeing significant spread, health officials said Friday.<br />Reported daily new cases reached a record high of 414,188 on Friday, and the Health Ministry reported 3,915 new deaths due to the disease.<br />India’s central government has been reluctant to impose nationwide pandemic control restrictions, fearful that they would cause further damage to an already ailing economy in the world’s second-most populous country.<br />“Currently national lockdown is not on the cards,” said Gopal Krishna Agarwal, a spokesman for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. “The extent and severity of the pandemic is different and the health infrastructure is quite varied,” and any restrictions should be up to local authorities."
