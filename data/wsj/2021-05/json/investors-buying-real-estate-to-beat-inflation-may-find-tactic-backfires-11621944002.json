    "body": "Investors are eyeing real estate as a way to hedge against inflation. Many are bound to be disappointed.<br />While single-family homes usually perform well during inflationary periods, values of offices, retail buildings and other commercial properties can tumble in value if owners aren’t in a position to increase rents, economists say.<br />Since the Labor Department this month reported a 4.2% annual increase in April consumer prices—the highest rate since 2008—the prospect of inflation has become an obsession in financial markets.<br />Many analysts and investors expect the surge to be brief. They suggest that the inflation jump reflects recent government spending, pent-up demand and production bottlenecks during the reopening of the U.S. economy. These forces should subside, as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic, and more traditional spending patterns resume.<br />But with a number of U.S. companies warning of higher prices, more investors are seeking assets whose value goes up when the value of money goes down."
