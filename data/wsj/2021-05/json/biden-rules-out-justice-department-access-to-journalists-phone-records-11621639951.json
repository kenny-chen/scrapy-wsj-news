    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden said he wouldn’t allow his Justice Department to gain access to journalists’ phone and email records.<br />“Absolutely positively it’s wrong,” he told reporters at the White House on Friday. “It’s simply, simply wrong.”<br />Mr. Biden’s comments come after CNN and the Washington Post said the Justice Department had informed them that the Trump administration sought and obtained reporters’ phone records from 2017, prompting objections from the news outlets and press-freedom organizations.<br />Asked if he would prevent his Justice Department from seizing records of journalists, Mr. Biden said, “I will not let that happen.”<br />(More to Come)"
