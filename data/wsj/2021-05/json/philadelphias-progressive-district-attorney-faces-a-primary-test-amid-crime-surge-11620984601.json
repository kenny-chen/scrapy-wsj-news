    "body": "Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, one of the highest-profile progressive prosecutors in the U.S., faces a re-election challenge that will test support for his reformist policies at a time of soaring homicide and shooting levels in the nation’s sixth-largest city.<br />Mr. Krasner squares off in Tuesday’s Democratic primary against Carlos Vega, a former prosecutor backed by the local police union whom Mr. Krasner fired shortly after his tenure began in 2018. The Democratic candidate for this position usually wins the November general election, with registered Democrats in the city outnumbering Republicans seven to one.<br />The Republican candidate, defense attorney Chuck Peruto, has said he would end his run if Mr. Vega wins the primary.<br />Mr. Krasner is one of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected in recent years who ran on a platform of reducing prosecutions for low-level crimes, changing bail conditions and not seeking the death penalty. How he fares will be an early gauge of their support, as cities nationwide grapple with an increase in murders and shootings.<br />One of Mr. Krasner’s early moves as DA was to fire more than 30 prosecutors, including Mr. Vega, who joined the office in 1982 and went on to become the state’s first Latino homicide prosecutor. Mr. Vega, 64 years old, filed an age-discrimination lawsuit that is pending in federal court. Mr. Krasner denies Mr. Vega’s claim."
