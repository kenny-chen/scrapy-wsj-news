    "body": "The oil supply glut that built up after the pandemic forced producing countries to slash output has almost returned to normal levels, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday.<br />But in its monthly report, the IEA cut its 2021 global demand growth forecast by 270,000 barrels to 5.4 million barrels a day. Demand in Europe and the Americas in the first quarter was weaker than previously thought, the IEA said. The agency cut its second-quarter forecast for Indian demand as the country struggles with high coronavirus infection rates.<br />The Paris-based organization left its demand estimates for the second half of the year unchanged, adding that vaccination rollout programs, rebounding economic activity and easing transport restrictions in the U.S. and Europe clear the way for crude demand to begin outstripping supply later this year.<br />The agency expects demand to outstrip supply even after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies raise output. The IEA cut its already moderate supply growth forecast for non-alliance producers to roughly half the amount of last year’s contraction, while also forecasting a further drop in U.S. production in line with OPEC’s forecast this week.<br />The supply stocks held by the wealthy nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development slipped to 1.7 million barrels above the five-year average of 2016-20, the IEA said. “Anticipated supply growth through the rest of this year comes nowhere close to matching our forecast for significantly stronger demand beyond the second quarter,” it said."
