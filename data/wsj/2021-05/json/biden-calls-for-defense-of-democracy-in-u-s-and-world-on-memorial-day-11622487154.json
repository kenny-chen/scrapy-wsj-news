    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden honored American military service members who died in the line of duty, using a Memorial Day address to call for a defense of democracy in the U.S. and around the globe.<br />“Democracy must be defended at all costs. For democracy makes this all possible,” Mr. Biden said Monday at an amphitheater in Arlington National Cemetery. “Democracy. That’s the soul of America. And I believe it’s a soul worth fighting for, and so do you, a soul worth dying for.”<br />Mr. Biden’s comments followed remarks he made earlier in the weekend, when he called voting measures in Texas, Florida and Georgia “an assault on democracy.”<br />Republican-backed bills with voting restrictions in several states have become a battleground between the GOP and Democrats recently. Texas Democrats walked out of the state House on Sunday to impede passage of a measure with voting restrictions.<br />Republicans say the laws protect election security and prevent fraud while Democrats say they restrict access to polls, including among minorities."
