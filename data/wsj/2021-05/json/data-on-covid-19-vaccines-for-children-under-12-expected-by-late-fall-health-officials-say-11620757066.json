    "body": "WASHINGTON—There will likely be enough evidence by late fall this year to potentially extend the use of Covid-19 vaccines to many children under age 12, Biden administration health officials told a U.S. Senate panel Tuesday.<br />“We expect to have data on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for children under 12” by that time, David Kessler, the administration’s chief Covid-19 scientific officer, told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.<br />Administration medical adviser Anthony Fauci told the panel that such steps to vaccinate younger children will probably occur in stages, progressing younger and younger, as study evidence accumulates.<br />The testimony occurred a day after the Food and Drug Administration greenlighted the use of a Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  in youngsters 12 through 15. That vaccine was authorized late last year by the FDA for broad use in people age 16 and older.<br />It also followed last week’s decision by the Biden administration to support the temporary waiver of intellectual property provisions to allow developing nations to produce Covid-19 vaccines created by pharmaceutical companies, citing the need to stop the virus’s spread globally."
