    "body": "Michael Schacht, 70 years old, is a typical German saver. Risk-averse, the clothing-shop owner kept the equivalent of $300,000 in a local bank in a small town near Hamburg.<br />Then, earlier this year, Mr. Schacht’s bank told him it wanted to charge him a negative 0.5% interest rate to hold his money.<br />Furious, Mr. Schacht did something he never considered: He put it all in the market. His portfolio includes investments in stocks and corporate bonds from Europe and elsewhere through funds, plus gold and silver.<br />“I don’t want to make lots of money, I just want a low-risk investment that provides a reasonable return on capital, like 2%, 4%,” Mr. Schacht said. “That has always been realistic in the past.”<br />More Germans entered the stock market for the first time during the pandemic than in any stretch since the dot-com boom. Deutsches Aktieninstitut, a finance-industry association, estimates that 2.7 million people in Germany started owning shares directly or through funds last year, boosting the investor total to 12.4 million, up 28% from 2019."
