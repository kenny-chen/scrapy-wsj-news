    "body": "Engineers developed the software and circuitry to make 5G possible. Corporate marketers are the ones explaining to the public how it all works.<br />That’s where things get complicated.<br />As with the previous generation of wireless service, cellphone carriers have pinned a confusing array of brand names on 5G services. Each type reveals a tradeoff: Some 5G signals can be found across broad swaths of the U.S. but have yet to deliver dramatically better internet speeds than their 4G counterparts. Other 5G connections are extremely fast but hard to find outside stadiums and business districts. For anyone confused by 5G’s many flavors, here’s a quick guide:<br />5G<br />What it means: AT&T uses this simple label to describe most of its next-generation cellular coverage. It applies to service in the carrier’s low- and midrange frequencies. Signals carried over low-range frequencies provide the slowest connections in the 5G universe but travel the farthest. High-frequency signals transmit more data at a faster rate but don’t travel very far. Midrange frequencies are a balance of speed and distance. Testing by research firm Opensignal shows that AT&T’s 5G service is about twice as fast as its 4G service—far short of 5G’s ultimate capability."
