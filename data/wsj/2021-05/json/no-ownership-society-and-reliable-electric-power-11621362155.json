    "body": "In “The No-Ownership Society” (Inside View, May 10), Andy Kessler reminds us how tenuous our “ownership” of devices that we’ve bought and paid for is. He’s only scratched the surface. I am responsible for two solar-power systems, one on my roof, the other at work. Four different vendors supply components of the system, and all four demand an internet connection to monitor and even control the system. There is no reason why these components, already present on my local network, cannot provide data to my desktop computer or phone app, yet they require this gratuitous connection.<br />One of the great benefits of solar power is self-sufficiency. If the grid goes down, one still has power for necessities or even for off-grid living. But if the grid goes down, most likely the internet will as well, and so will the ability to get one’s own data from the far-flung vendors. While interconnection is great, so is resiliency and the ability to be independent during emergencies. Health, solar, maintenance and other user-generated data should be available at its source without a round trip to another state, country or continent.<br />Richard Factor<br />Sedona, Ariz."
