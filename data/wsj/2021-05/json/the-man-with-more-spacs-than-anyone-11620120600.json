    "body": "Alec Gores has built a SPAC machine.<br />The billionaire investor, who first tried his hand at the unconventional reverse-merger IPO process in 2015, has watched the market for SPACs reach a fever pitch over the last two years. As the market swelled, he became a serial SPAC backer. He has methodically created 13 special-purpose acquisition companies, more than any other single investor, according to data provider SPACInsider.<br />Mr. Gores is a veteran when measured in SPAC years. He believes in the process, which had been criticized as an avenue to take sketchy companies public. His firm, Gores Group, opens its own checkbook for every deal—unlike many other SPAC investors—and sometimes even lands deals despite underbidding his competitors, he says.<br />“We’re building a franchise,” Mr. Gores said in an interview from his home in Malibu, Calif. “We’re developing a playbook that gets improved every day.”<br />Last year, Mr. Gores was in deal talks with Austin Russell, the 26-year-old chief executive officer of  Luminar  Technologies Inc. Despite the global Covid-19 pandemic, the SPAC market was on fire. Bankers said Mr. Russell’s self-driving-car sensor company could easily secure a $9 billion valuation."
