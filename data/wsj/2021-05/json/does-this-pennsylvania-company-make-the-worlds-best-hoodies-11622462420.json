    "body": "BEIGE HABILLEUR, a boutique tucked away in Paris’s tony 16th arrondissement, stocks a cosmopolitan assortment of men’s clothes including $330 mandarin-collared dress shirts from Italy’s Salvatore Piccolo and $1,400 Edward Green tassel loafers. But Beige also stocks a far humbler product: $150-ish American-made hoodies by Camber USA. (This price is marked up internationally, and Americans can find Camber hoodies for half that price.)<br />Camber’s hoodies are as thick as a bath mat and tender on the inside, like an old blanket that has been through the spin cycle a few dozen times. Certain fastidious fans of fleece hold them up as some of the best hoodies in the world. When Matthew Spade, 35, a social media content creator in Blackpool, England, recently embarked on a quest to find the ultimate sweatshirt, Camber’s chunky pullover won out. He specifically likes what he calls Camber’s “hood integrity.” As Mr. Spade demonstrated over a Zoom call, even when worn down, the stocky hood stacks up to his earlobes like a permanent scarf.<br />These sweatshirts, though, are devilishly hard to find in England. When the very few online stores based in the U.K. that sell Camber products post them online, they “sell out quicker than a hiccup, it’s actually ridiculous,” said Mr. Spade. International online sites often demand exorbitant shipping costs or won’t ship to the U.K. Mr. Spade resorted to buying his gray Camber hoodie from a friend.<br />It’s not just Europe that cherishes Camber. On Instagram you can often find posts from immaculately dressed, sweatshirt-wearing Japanese folks, with the hashtag #CamberUSA. Search Camber USA on YouTube and you’ll find a video by an excitable American with the partial title “The BEST Made in USA sweatshirt.”<br />Camber might have a worldwide reputation, but it’s achieved that in spite of its indifferent approach to marketing. Camber is “kind of elusive,” said Robert Davison, 26, a graphic designer in Brooklyn and Camber aficionado. He couldn’t even find an Instagram account for the company when he looked recently."
