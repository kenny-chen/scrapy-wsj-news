    "body": "TEL AVIV—An unidentified man stabbed two Israelis including a soldier in Jerusalem on Monday, as Israeli police launched an operation to track down and arrest those involved in communal violence that erupted earlier this month.<br />The two victims—one was severely wounded—were evacuated to hospital, Israeli medical services said. Footage and images on social media showed an Israeli soldier kneeling with a knife in his back as medics worked to stem the bleeding.<br />Israeli police said it shot dead the assailant but didn’t provide further details.<br />The attack comes amid heightened tensions between the Palestinians and Israelis, despite a cease-fire Friday between Gaza-ruler Hamas and Israel that ended 11 days of intense fighting. The tensions have been exacerbated by the worst violence in decades between Israel’s Jews and its two million Arab citizens, about a fifth of its population, over the Israel-Hamas conflict.<br />Over the past two weeks, Israeli police have arrested more than 1,500 people suspected of taking part in the disturbances, indicting about 150 suspects, it said Monday. The weeklong operation—dubbed Law and Order—will include thousands of police officers and border troops, including reservists, the police said."
