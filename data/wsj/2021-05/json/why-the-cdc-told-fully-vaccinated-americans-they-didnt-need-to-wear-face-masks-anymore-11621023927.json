    "body": "Behind the decision by federal health officials to effectively end face-mask and distancing recommendations for the fully vaccinated, they said, was a mix of recent research, increasing vaccinations and declining case counts.<br />The guidelines issued this week largely follow the growing body of scientific evidence on the effectiveness of the vaccines against Covid-19, especially given the current state of the pandemic in the U.S., according to public-health specialists.<br />Parsing the new recommendations and putting them into practice now shifts to states, communities and businesses. It will likely be especially difficult in public settings like stores or workplaces, health researchers say, since there isn’t an easy way to determine who is fully vaccinated.<br />“There are states that I believe will continue to require masks in public spaces, simply because we cannot tell who is vaccinated or who is not,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers someone fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of the  Pfizer Inc.  and BioNTech SE or  Moderna Inc.  vaccines or two weeks following the single dose of the  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine."
