    "body": "U.S. health regulators have for the first time cleared a Covid-19 vaccine’s use in children, paving the way for many to be immunized before summer camps and the start of the next school year.<br />Millions of people ages 16 years and older have taken the shot from  Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE .  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decision Monday widens the vaccine’s use to children as young as 12.<br />The move comes after a study of 2,260 adolescents found the two-dose shot worked safely in that age group.<br />Its expanded use is expected to boost a vaccination campaign seeking to immunize as many people as possible before dangerous variants able to elude shots emerge. Wider use of the vaccines also could permit easing of pandemic measures.<br />The expansion “is a significant step in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock. “Today’s action allows for a younger population to be protected from Covid-19, bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic."
