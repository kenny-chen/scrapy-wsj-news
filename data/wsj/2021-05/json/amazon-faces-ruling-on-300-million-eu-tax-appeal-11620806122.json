    "body": "Amazon . com Inc. struck a new blow to European Union efforts to wring more tax from big tech companies when the bloc’s second-highest court sided with the company over a $300 million tax bill.<br />The EU court on Wednesday annulled a 2017 decision from the European Commission, the EU’s top antitrust authority, that had ordered Amazon to pay 250 million euros in taxes to Luxembourg, the latest of several big EU tax decisions to be overturned.<br />In its decision, the court backed Amazon, saying that EU regulators had failed to prove that the company got an illegal advantage from tax rulings issued by Luxembourg, and saying that the commission’s analysis had been “incorrect in several respects.”<br />Amazon said it welcomed the decision, “which is in line with our long-standing position that we followed all applicable laws and that Amazon received no special treatment.”<br />The ruling is a significant blow to Margrethe Vestager, an executive vice president of the commission who is leading a campaign to curb alleged excesses by some of the world’s largest tech companies, including Amazon,  Apple Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google."
