    "body": "If Democrats pack the U.S. Supreme Court, they will do irreparable damage to the institution. But the harm wouldn’t end there. President Biden’s commission to study the idea is already undermining U.S. moral authority on the rule of law and the separation of powers in Latin America.<br />Exhibit A is El Salvador, where a newly elected congressional majority backing President Nayib Bukele last week illegally fired the five-member Constitutional Court. The pro-Bukele congress immediately named its own handpicked court in violation of the legal process for choosing new magistrates. Congress also fired the attorney general without cause the same day.<br />Rep. James McGovern (D., Mass.), who never met a left-wing Latin dictator he didn’t love, expressed his outrage on  Twitter : “Let us be clear: this is not democracy, this is the destruction of an independent judiciary and the rule of law.”<br />Mr. Bukele was unperturbed. He responded to the congressman by posting a puzzled, chin-stroking emoji above a news story about Mr. Biden’s new commission. The not-so-subtle message: Why not do what the U.S. does rather than what it says?<br />In a speech at Harvard Law School last month, Justice Stephen Breyerwarned against court packing: “If the public sees judges as ‘politicians in robes,’ its confidence in the courts, and in the rule of law itself, can only diminish, diminishing the court’s power, including its power to act as a ‘check’ on the other branches.”"
