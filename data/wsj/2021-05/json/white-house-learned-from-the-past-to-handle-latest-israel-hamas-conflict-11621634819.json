    "body": "Biden administration officials made a conscious decision to avoid publicly clashing with Israel during the latest fighting in the Middle East, officials with knowledge of the discussions said, in part because they believed an antagonistic U.S. approach aggravated tensions during the last conflict, in 2014.<br />Instead, the administration tried to keep the U.S. out of public international and domestic debates over the fighting and to give Israel the space to carry out its military objectives, while keeping communication channels open and quietly working with partners in Egypt, Qatar and Israel to seek an end to the conflict.<br />President Biden, an ally of Israel throughout his career, backed the country’s right to self-defense against Hamas rocket attacks, in contrast to many other Democrats, while some in the GOP called for stronger public support.<br />The approach, described by several officials with knowledge of the discussions, reflected a marked departure from the last eruption of Middle East fighting, when then-President Barack Obamacriticized Israel’s heavy attacks on Gaza.<br />The Biden administration officials held to their strategy despite alarm over a rising civilian death toll, particularly in Gaza, and pressure from Democratic lawmakers to take a firm stance against what some of them saw as disproportionate Israeli aggression."
