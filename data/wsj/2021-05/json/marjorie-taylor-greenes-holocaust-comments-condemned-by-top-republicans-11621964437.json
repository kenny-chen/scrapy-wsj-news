    "body": "WASHINGTON—Top Republicans condemned comments Tuesday from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.) comparing proof of Covid-19 vaccinations to actions taken against Jewish people by Nazi Germany leading up to the Holocaust.<br />Mrs. Greene, who was stripped of her committee assignments earlier this year over inflammatory comments she made before being elected, sparked new outrage over her comments about vaccination status.<br />“Vaccinated employees get a vaccination logo just like the Nazi’s forced Jewish people to wear a gold star,” Mrs. Greene said Tuesday morning on Twitter, as she retweeted a story about a grocery chain permitting fully vaccinated employees to not wear a mask and have a vaccination logo on their name badge. “Vaccine passports & mask mandates create discrimination against unvaxxed people who trust their immune systems,” she said.<br />House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) issued a statement Tuesday condemning Mrs. Greene’s comments.<br />“Marjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling,” Mr. McCarthy said. “Let me be clear: the House Republican Conference condemns this language.”"
