    "body": "Venture-capital firm Kaszek is raising about $800 million for two new funds, seizing on interest among global investors in startups in Latin America, according to sources.<br />A representative of Kaszek, whose main office is in São Paulo, declined to comment on the fundraising, which comes as Latin America garners attention for its tech market’s growth prospects.<br />The market capitalization of publicly traded Latin American tech companies accounted for only 2.2% of regional gross domestic product last year, compared with 39% in the U.S., according to an analysis by Brazilian venture firm Atlantico.<br />“There is so much more ‘room to grow’ here than anywhere else, so the potential is massive given we’re talking about 600 million people and $5 trillion in GDP,” said Julio Vasconcellos, managing partner at Atlantico.<br />Portfolio companies of Kaszek, founded a decade ago by managing partners Hernan Kazah and Nicolas Szekasy, former executives of Argentinian e-commerce company  MercadoLibre Inc.,  have received some of the largest financing rounds in the region recently."
