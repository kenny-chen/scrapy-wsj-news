    "body": "Amazon ’s  disruptive streak hasn’t yet extended to the grocery aisles. Supermarkets should still be on their toes.<br />It has been 14 years since Amazon began its grocery-delivery service, Amazon Fresh, and about four years since the company bought Whole Foods. Yet Amazon’s total grocery market share is still underwhelming. For the year ended March 31, Amazon.com and Whole Foods had 1.4% and 1.2% of the grocery spending in the U.S., respectively, according to data from Numerator. Industry stalwarts  Walmart  and  Kroger  had total market shares of 22% and 12%.<br />Amazon’s sales through Whole Foods have been stagnant. Its physical- stores segment, which primarily reflects in-person sales at Whole Foods, has seen annual revenue decline since 2018, the first full year of integration after the grocery chain’s acquisition. The segment’s year-over-year revenue decline of 16% in the March quarter was the company’s worst on record, as Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky noted that foot traffic to Whole Foods remained down. Sales of prepared foods—a major component of the high-end grocer’s business—saw a big drop during the pandemic and have yet to fully recover, he added during a call to discuss Amazon’s first-quarter results last month.<br />Whole Foods, however, is only a piece of Amazon’s grocery ambitions. The company has run Amazon Fresh for a while now. And it has begun building physical stores under that brand. There are 12 such stores currently, with a new one slated to open in Virginia on May 27. Amazon has also announced plans to rebrand its smaller Go convenience stores—of which there are 22 locations—under the Fresh label.<br />Amazon would have a natural advantage in grocery delivery. Yet less than 3% of its domestic fulfillment centers are dedicated to fresh-food delivery, according to estimates from the logistics consulting firm MWPVL International. So far, reviews of the physical Fresh stores have been mixed. On Google Reviews, shoppers gave high ratings overall but often remarked on the high percentage of “pickers,” or employees picking up items for delivery, as well as the limits of the so-called Dash Cart, which shoppers aren’t allowed to take to the parking lot. Shoppers can skip the checkout line by placing items in the smart cart and paying through the Amazon app on their phones."
