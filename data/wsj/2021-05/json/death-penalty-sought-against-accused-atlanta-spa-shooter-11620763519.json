    "body": "ATLANTA—A Georgia grand jury indicted Robert Aaron Long on multiple murder counts and other charges for the March 16 spa shootings here, and a prosecutor signaled she would seek the death penalty, according to documents filed Tuesday.<br />Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis also filed papers with the court that state she planned to prosecute the shootings as hate crimes.<br />Eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were killed in the attacks at three spas—two in Atlanta and one in suburban Cherokee County. Mr. Long, now 22 years old, was captured by police as he was fleeing the state toward Florida. Police said he told them he frequented the spas for sex and committed the violence to lash out against what he considered temptation.<br />The 19 indictments filed in Fulton County Tuesday are for the shootings at the two Atlanta spas. They include four counts of murder, four counts of felony murder, five counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, five counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and one domestic terrorism charge.<br />Mr. Long also faces charges for the murders at the shooting at the Cherokee County spa."
