    "body": "Prices for the building blocks of the economy have surged over the past year. Oil, copper, corn and gasoline futures all cost about twice what they did a year ago, when much of the world was locked down to fight the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Lumber has more than tripled.<br />A lot of investors would probably see this chart and say it screams inflation.<br />Soaring commodity prices have stoked fierce debate on Wall Street and in Washington, D.C. over inflation and whether the fiscal and monetary policies intended to buffer the economy during the pandemic might now risk hobbling the recovery.<br />At the heart of the debate is how much of the climb in commodity prices can be attributed to transitory, temporary shocks that should ease as the world’s economy moves further from lockdown, and how much of the rise will last and spread to other things.<br />In many markets, the factors driving up prices appear fleeting. The economic reopening has been bumpy. Inventories are depleted, leading to big restocking orders and putting premiums on near-term deliveries of raw materials. Supply lines are jammed, creating pockets of scarcity and adding costs that are passed on to consumers. Some of the price gains seem sharp but have only just completed their recovery from last spring’s pandemic market panic."
