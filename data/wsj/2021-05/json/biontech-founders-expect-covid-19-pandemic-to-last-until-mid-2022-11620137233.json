    "body": "The surge of coronavirus infections in developing countries such as India amid a relative scarcity of vaccine supply means that the pandemic will keep spreading until mid-2022, according to the inventors of the first Covid-19 vaccine authorized in the West.<br />Because of the urgency, authorities should consider such measures as mixing and matching vaccines from different manufacturers, said the founders of  BioNTech SE  at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit on Tuesday. The German company teamed up with  Pfizer Inc.  to test, manufacture and distribute its vaccine.<br />“We need to ensure really high vaccination rates world-wide. Otherwise, no one will be safe,” said Uğur Şahin, BioNTech’s chief executive officer. He said the pandemic would only end when herd immunity is accomplished world-wide.<br />“By mid-2022, even regions with high density populations like India will reach a high rate of vaccination and herd immunity,” Dr. Şahin said. “We will see in the next 12 months an increasing number of industrial, developing and low-income countries reaching this type of herd immunity just by increasing the manufacturing capacity of the currently existing players and adding new manufacturing sites.”<br />Dr. Şahin, who founded the company with his wife, Özlem Türeci, said that they were expanding their manufacturing alliance of more 30 companies in order to produce more vaccines to supply countries such as India."
