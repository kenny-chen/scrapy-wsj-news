    "body": "Jobless claims likely held near pandemic lows last week, a sign hiring is poised to strengthen as soon as more workers return to the labor market.<br />Economists expect Americans filed 500,000 claims for unemployment benefits last week, up slightly from a pandemic low of 498,000 a week earlier. Claims have come down from a recent January peak of about 900,000, though they remain more than twice as high as levels seen before the pandemic struck last spring.<br />“Employers are really clinging to their talent,” said Jay Denton, chief analyst for ThinkWhy, a labor-analytics firm. “There’s a lot of demand there. We will start to see more hiring.”<br />Higher vaccination rates, fiscal stimulus and easing business restrictions are converging to support stronger spending across the U.S. But job growth isn’t keeping pace. U.S. employers added a modest 266,000 jobs in April, far short of the one million that economists had forecast and the weakest monthly gain since January.<br />Many employers say they cannot find enough workers to meet surging demand, in turn limiting production. Economists cite several factors keeping workers on the sidelines, including expanded $300 unemployment benefits, individuals’ fear of contracting Covid-19 and child-care burdens due to school closures."
