    "body": "Two climbers, one American and the other Swiss, have died on Mount Everest in the first casualties of the climbing season on the world's tallest mountain, expedition organizers said.<br />U.S. national Puwei Lei, 55 years old, managed to get as far as the Hillary Step, located between the highest camp at South Col and the summit, but had to turn back because of snow blindness and exhaustion, expedition leader Seven Summit Treks said Thursday<br />Chhang Dawa Sherpa, a director at the Nepal-based company, said that with the help of additional Sherpas—members of an ethnic group from the Himalayan valleys—and extra oxygen, Mr. Lei managed to return to the South Col base late on Wednesday evening before he died.<br />Abdul Waraich, a 41-year-old climber from Switzerland, died on the way back down after reaching the summit. He also suffered from exhaustion. “We sent two additional Sherpas with oxygen and food. Unfortunately, the Sherpas couldn’t save him,” Mr. Dawa said in an Instagram post.<br />It isn’t clear when the expedition might be able to bring bodies down to lower altitudes. Bad weather conditions have hampered the operation, which can be time-consuming and dangerous even in good conditions."
