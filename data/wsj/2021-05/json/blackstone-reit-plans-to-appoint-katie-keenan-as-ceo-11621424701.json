    "body": "Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc.,  a large commercial real-estate lender, is expected to appoint Katie Keenan as chief executive Wednesday, partly crediting the role she played in helping navigate the company through one of the most challenging markets in decades.<br />Ms. Keenan, 36 years old, has been president of the real-estate investment trust that was created by investment giant  Blackstone Group Inc.,  one of the world’s largest commercial real-estate owners. She is set to succeed Steve Plavin, who will be overseeing  Blackstone  Group’s European debt business.<br />The real-estate investment trust, which went public in 2013, has a $18.7 billion portfolio of first mortgage loans that it made to owners of office buildings, warehouses, apartment properties and other commercial real estate in North America, Europe and Australia.<br />Like many first mortgage lenders, the Blackstone REIT moved to the sidelines during the first six months of the pandemic. But business has picked up this year, with $1.7 billion worth of new loans made in the first quarter of 2021, according to the firm.<br />“We’re back in growth mode,” Ms. Keenan said in an interview."
