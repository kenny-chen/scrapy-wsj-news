    "body": "President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen promoted the administration’s infrastructure and tax plans as vital for the U.S. to compete globally, as the White House and Republican lawmakers continued to pursue a deal to improve the nation’s bridges, roads and broadband internet.<br />Proclaiming himself a “car guy,” Mr. Biden visited Dearborn, Mich., Tuesday to tour the Ford Motor Co. Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, using the facility to pitch his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, which includes funding for electric vehicles. He argued that his proposals would help create jobs and make the U.S. more competitive with countries like China.<br />“The future of the auto industry is electric,” he said. “The real question is whether we’ll lead or we’ll fall behind in the race to the future. And whether we’ll build these vehicles and the batteries that go in them here in the United States or in other countries.”<br />Mr. Biden spoke in front of a lineup of trucks and referred to the Ford F-150 Lightning, a new electric pickup. Afterward he test-drove a vehicle that the White House said was that model.<br />“This sucker’s quick,” Mr. Biden told reporters. Asked if he would take a question about Israel, he said, “Not unless you get in front of the car as I step on it.” He then said he was teasing."
