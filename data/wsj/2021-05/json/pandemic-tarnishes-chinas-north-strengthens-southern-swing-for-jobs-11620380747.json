    "body": "The economic fallout from the pandemic has heightened regional disparities in China, creating fresh incentives for people to leave the country’s industrial heartlands in search of better jobs further south.<br />That is likely to add to a long-term trend of internal migration toward the warmer, faster-growing areas. China’s richer southern regions have a bigger share of newer sectors such as biotechnology and electric vehicles, while northern and central China houses more of the country’s traditional heavy-industrial base, such as coal mines and steel mills.<br />While official population data for 2020 isn’t available yet, the shift already appears to be showing up in regional housing markets, which are thriving in southern hubs and faltering in some cities further north, including parts of China’s rust belt.<br />In the southern technological powerhouse of Shenzhen for example, existing-home prices climbed 14% last year, National Bureau of Statistics data showed.<br />Meanwhile, prices fell 10% in the same period in one of the weakest markets, Mudanjiang, a small city in the far northeastern province of Heilongjiang. They also retreated in bigger, northern cities such as nearby Harbin. In Tianjin, a northern port city near Beijing, existing-home prices dropped 4% in 2020."
