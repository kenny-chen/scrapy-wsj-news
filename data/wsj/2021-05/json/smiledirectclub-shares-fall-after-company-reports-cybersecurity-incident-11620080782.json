    "body": "SmileDirectClub Inc.  said a cyberattack last month disrupted the company’s operations and will hurt its sales this quarter. The disclosure sent shares lower in after-hours trading.<br />The company, which sells teeth-straightening retainers, said in a securities filing that it was able to isolate the hack by shutting down affected systems and related manufacturing operations.<br />“The Company was able to successfully block the attack, no ransom was paid, and the Company’s systems and operations are back online and performing normally,” it said in the filing.<br />SmileDirectClub said that the incident may delay and disrupt parts of business, including treatment planning, manufacturing and product delivery.<br />It estimated that the attack and associated downtime would cost it $10 million to $15 million in revenue. The company said it now expects revenue in the second quarter in a range of about $195 million to $200 million. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting sales of $206.7 million for the second quarter."
