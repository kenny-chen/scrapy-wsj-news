    "body": "Federal agents and the New York Police Department are fighting a rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes by launching new investigations and increasing community outreach and patrols in affected neighborhoods.<br />Federal Bureau of Investigation officials said agents discussed anti-Semitic crimes with Jewish groups and held meetings and conference calls with community leaders in May as more than two dozen crimes with anti-Semitic motivations were reported to the NYPD.<br />The FBI also intensified a public-relations campaign to encourage reporting of such crimes to authorities in New York. The push includes posters with instructions for reporting hate crimes in languages including Yiddish, Hebrew and Mandarin.<br />The FBI defines hate crimes as crimes in which perpetrators act on a bias against the victim’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, or other categories. Hate crimes potentially carry a more severe penalty than crimes without the designation.<br />William Sweeney, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s New York Field Office, said hate crimes against Jews in New York rose when fighting in the Middle East between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas recently began. The two sides agreed to a cease-fire starting May 21 after 11 days of conflict."
