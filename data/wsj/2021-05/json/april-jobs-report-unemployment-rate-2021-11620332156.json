    "body": "Employers likely added jobs at a robust pace for the second straight month in April, signaling a speedy economic recovery from last year’s historic downturn.<br />Economists expect payrolls grew by one million in April after rising by 916,000 in March. They project the unemployment rate fell to 5.8%, down from 6% in March and a record-high 14.8% last April when the pandemic struck.<br />Higher vaccination rates, fiscal stimulus and easing business restrictions are converging to support an economic boom across the U.S.<br />“The pieces are really coming together for a burst in activity,” said Sarah House, senior economist for Wells Fargo’s Corporate and Investment Bank. “We’re expecting to see the labor market recovery shift into an even faster gear with the April jobs report.”<br />Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services made in the U.S., grew at a 6.4% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter. Economists expect households—many of them vaccinated and with a recent round of stimulus money—to further power growth this year by shelling out money on services."
