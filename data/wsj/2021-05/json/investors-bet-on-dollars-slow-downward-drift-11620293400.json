    "body": "Some investors are betting on a slow, steady grind downward for the U.S. dollar.<br />Hedge funds and asset managers are scooping up derivatives that pay off when the dollar declines slowly or stays within a narrow range. In one strategy, known as a strangle, traders sell both bullish and bearish options for short periods. They can collect a premium from selling the contracts and profit as long as the underlying currency remains steady and doesn’t trigger the options.<br />The bets on a calm retreat mark a shift after last year’s pandemic-heightened swings. Many expected the dollar to slide in 2021, as global growth outpaced the U.S. expansion. Instead the U.S.’s rapid vaccine rollout and economic resurgence have supported the currency, reducing volatility along with the opportunity for traders to make money off swings. The WSJ Dollar Index has gained roughly 1.4% this year.<br />Kristen Macleod, co-head of global foreign exchange sales at  Barclays ,  said trade strategies that involve selling volatility stand out as a clear trend at a time when hedge funds and asset managers have a higher bar for betting in currency markets than earlier this year.<br />Hedge funds and other speculative investors have increased bets on a weaker dollar in recent weeks, though net short positions remain much less extreme than they were late last year, data from Scotiabank and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show."
