    "body": "Competition with China will define the coming decades, and Congress wants to get into the game. Alas it’s off to a bad start with the Senate’s nearly 1,500-page Innovation and Competition Act that won’t help innovation or competitiveness.<br />The bill has some useful provisions that deserve to be considered separately—such as economic sanctions against Chinese entities linked to cyber and IP theft and officials involved in human-rights abuses, and a repeal of the Global Magnitsky Act’s 2022 sunset.<br />But the bill’s bipartisan support has less to do with China than with its typical Congressional spending blowout and parochial politics. “Everyone knows this thing is going to pass, so every lobbyist wants to add everything they can,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, the bill’s lead House sponsor, with refreshing candor. This is how industrial policy always works in practice.<br />Start with the $54 billion for the not-so-needy U.S. semiconductor industry. Manufacturing computer chips—as opposed to design—has been commoditized due to economies of scale, with  Samsung ,   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC)  and  Intel  dominating fabrication.<br />While the U.S. accounts for 12% of chip manufacturing, American companies dominate in design (52%) and chip-making equipment (50%). This is where the U.S. has a comparative advantage and China trails by leaps and bounds. Credit American semiconductor research and development spending by private companies."
