    "body": "For Southeast Asia’s technology industry, Grab Holdings Inc.’s record-breaking deal to go public via a SPAC is a watershed moment.<br />Bankers and investors have long talked up Southeast Asia’s potential, and venture-capital funds have poured billions of dollars into the region. But so far, few of those investments have translated into big paydays from large listings or takeovers. And stock-market investors have had few ways to get in on the action, apart from the gaming and e-commerce group Sea Ltd.<br />With Grab, a Singapore-headquartered ride-hailing and delivery company, set to join Sea on the Nasdaq Stock Market, that is changing fast. Meanwhile, two other heavyweights, Gojek and Tokopedia, are working on a merger that could be a prelude to another big listing.<br />The $40 billion Grab deal “will attract a lot of investor attention and interest in the market,” said Chua Kee Lock, chief executive of Vertex Holdings.  Vertex  is the venture-capital arm of Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, and was Grab’s first institutional investor. “Before Grab, nobody made money from investing in Southeast Asia startups other than Sea,” he said.<br />Mr. Chua said today’s Southeast Asia is like China about 15 years ago, when the country’s first batch of startups went public in the U.S. and caused a splash. Chinese giants such as  Tencent Holdings Ltd. ,  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and  JD.com Inc.  now rank among the world’s biggest tech firms."
