    "body": "China said its population hit 1.41178 billion in 2020, eking out a tiny rise from 1.4005 billion for the previous year, underlining how the world’s most populous nation is going to have to face its demographic challenges sooner than expected.<br />The number indicated that China’s population has only gone up by 72 million since the last census, in 2010, which is likely to increase pressure on Beijing to ease remaining birth restrictions.<br />China’s National Bureau of Statistics only released the total population number without any details on births or deaths in 2020. In recent months, other measures have indicated that fewer babies were born in the country in 2020 than in any year since 1961, when China was suffering mass starvation. Meanwhile, the population of older Chinese continues to balloon.<br />The data showed a sharp rise in the percentage of Chinese aged 60 and above, to 18.7% of the population from 13.3% in 2010.<br />The portion of Chinese aged between 15 and 59 stood at 63.35% in 2020, down from 70.1% in 2010."
