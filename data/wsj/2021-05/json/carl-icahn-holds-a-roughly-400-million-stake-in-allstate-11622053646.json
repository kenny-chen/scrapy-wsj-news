    "body": "Carl Icahn holds a roughly $400 million stake in  Allstate Corp.  and supports the insurer’s moves to cut costs and sell more products directly to consumers, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The stake amounts to about 1% of Northbrook, Ill.-based Allstate, which has a market value of roughly $40.5 billion.<br />The billionaire activist bought the position when Allstate’s shares were trading around $90 each last year, the people said. Mr. Icahn’s team concluded Allstate’s share price was significantly undervalued compared with that of rival  Progressive Corp. , they said.<br />Mr. Icahn, known for his raucous activist campaigns, has been uncharacteristically quiet at Allstate because the company was already undertaking the changes he had envisioned. It hasn’t hurt that the shares closed Wednesday at over $135, buoyed by a cost-cutting plan.<br />In September, Allstate said it was laying off 3,800 employees in claims, sales and support roles, part of its goal to reduce costs and further improve profit margins. The layoffs represent about 8% of the insurer’s approximately 46,000 workers."
