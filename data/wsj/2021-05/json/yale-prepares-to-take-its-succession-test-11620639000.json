    "body": "Investment pioneer David Swensen was the face of Yale University’s endowment for more than 35 years before he died last week. Behind the scenes, Yale began confronting a future without him years ago.<br />The university has ramped up preparations for this moment since Mr. Swensen was diagnosed with late-stage renal cancer in 2012, said people familiar with the matter. His illness brought new urgency to succession planning on the part of both Mr. Swensen and Yale.<br />In the years after his diagnosis, Mr. Swensen gave regular updates on his health to Yale’s investment committee. He also kept and regularly revised a list of potential successors. He discussed what he viewed as their strengths and weaknesses with people who will play a role in determining who gets the job, including Yale President Peter Salovey and some members of the endowment’s investment committee, said some of the people.<br />Some of these candidates work at the Yale Investments Office, as the endowment is known, while others were external candidates. Mr. Swensen’s thoughts are expected to inform how Yale’s leadership weighs how to replace the unofficial dean of endowment investing.<br />Yale on Friday said it would announce a process for appointing a new investment chief; the people familiar with the matter said Yale plans to conduct a search. University trustees recognize that the role will evolve with a new investment chief, said one of the people. Still, the person said trustees believe Mr. Swensen built an endowment culture and framework that will endure."
