Thirteen people died on the spot. Two children, aged nine and five, were found with severe injuries and flown by helicopter to a hospital in Turin. The older child died, and the younger child was being treated for multiple injuries late Sunday.<br />“It is an enormous tragedy,” said Marcella Severino, the mayor of Stresa, the lakeside town from which the cable car takes people up a nearby mountain.<br />Italian leaders expressed shock and condolences, including President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Mario Draghi.<br />The causes of the accident are unknown, authorities said. Local media reported that victims included Italians, Israelis and an Iranian-born man."
