    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration will begin distributing $350 billion to state and local governments this month, giving them money to pay for pandemic-related costs, fill revenue shortfalls and pay for water, sewer and broadband projects—but not to cut state taxes.<br />Money could start flowing to state, local and tribal governments within days, senior administration officials said Monday.<br />“These governments have endured unprecedented strains, forcing many to make untenable choices,” said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo.<br />Many state and local governments struggled during the pandemic as tax revenue temporarily dropped and businesses closed. But the shortfalls were, in some cases, not as bad as initially feared or nonexistent, and the federal aid could leave some governments unusually flush. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, expecting a $75.7 billion budget surplus, proposed on Monday a $100 billion stimulus and relief plan.<br />The Treasury Department also released rules that spell out how state and local governments can use the money—and how they can’t. The most controversial piece is a prohibition on using the money to pay for state tax cuts."
