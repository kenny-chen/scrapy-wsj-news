    "body": "OTTAWA—A series of sexual-misconduct allegations against Canadian military leaders has sparked a public outcry in the country, triggering a wide-ranging investigation into the culture of its armed forces.<br />A current parliamentary probe involves a former top soldier and his successor and has put Prime Minister Justin Trudeau under pressure over whether he is delivering on a campaign promise to advance women’s rights and end harassment in the workplace.<br />Canada is far from the only Western nation to face a reckoning over sexual misconduct complaints in its armed forces. But analysts say it has lagged behind the U.S. in addressing complaints, in part because legislative oversight of the military is among the weakest relative to other major Western democracies.<br />The most high-profile allegation involves Canada’s recently retired top soldier, Gen. Jonathan Vance, and claims that he engaged in a sexual relationship with a female subordinate over a number of years, and made a sexual comment toward a junior officer some time in early 2018. Both have been the subject of a military-police investigation and a parliamentary inquiry since February.<br />Approached outside his home in Ottawa earlier this month, Gen. Vance declined to comment on either of the allegations, which had been reported by Canada’s Global Television Network in February."
