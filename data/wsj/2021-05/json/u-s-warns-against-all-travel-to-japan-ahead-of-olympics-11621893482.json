    "body": "WASHINGTON—The State Department warned Americans against all travel to Japan because of the risk posed by the Covid-19 pandemic on Monday, raising its travel advisory for the country to its highest level two months ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.<br />The State Department’s travel advisories are designed to warn travelers about dangers overseas. It now sets Japan at “Level 4: Do Not Travel.” Americans are still permitted to travel to Japan but do so at their own risk.<br />Last month, the State Department warned against travel to about 80% of the world, as countries continued to grapple with surges of the virus while the situation at home improves.<br />The seven-day rolling average of reported U.S. Covid-19 cases has fallen below 30,000 per day and is steadily decreasing, as more of the nation gets vaccinated against the deadly illness. Nationally, more than 39% of people have been fully vaccinated and over 49% have had at least one vaccine dose.<br />By comparison, Japan has only just begun to roll out the large-scale vaccination of its elderly population. Domestically, opposition to the Olympics is growing. Some prominent Japanese business leaders have warned that holding the games could be more damaging to the economy in the long run."
