    "body": "The unemployment rate in April nationwide was 6.1%, but this obscures giant variations in the states. With some exceptions, those run by Democrats such as California (8.3%) and New York (8.2%) continued to suffer significantly higher unemployment than those led by Republicans such as South Dakota (2.8%) and Montana (3.7%).<br />It’s rare to see differences that are so stark based on party control in states. But the current partisan differences reflect different policy choices over the length and severity of pandemic lockdowns and now government benefits such as jobless insurance.<br />Nine of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates are led by Republicans. The exception is Wisconsin whose Supreme Court last May invalidated Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’s lockdown. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin is 3.9%—the same as Indiana—compared to 7.1% in Illinois whose Gov. J.B. Pritzker has been slow to reopen.<br />Jobs may be slow to recover in severe lockdown states if businesses shut down permanently. There may also be a delayed wave of small business closures once owners use up Paycheck Protection Program loans. While Congress made the loans forgivable, businesses that didn’t spend 60% of the proceeds on payroll will have to pay them back.<br />That includes a lot of restaurants and personal care services that were forced to close their doors and lay off workers during lockdowns but still had to pay rent and other overhead costs. In short, the labor market recovery in many states may be slower than it should be."
