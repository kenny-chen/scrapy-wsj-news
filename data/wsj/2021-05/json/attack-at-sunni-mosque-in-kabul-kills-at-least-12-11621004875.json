    "body": "KABUL—A blast at a Sunni mosque on the outskirts of Kabul killed at least 12 people on Friday, Afghan officials said, wrecking a three-day cease-fire that was declared between the government and the Taliban during the Muslim Eid holiday.<br />The Afghan government didn’t immediately comment on the attack. The Taliban denied a role in the bombing and blamed the Afghan government.<br />The attack was the first major outbreak of violence in Kabul after a triple bombing at a girls’ school last weekend in a Shiite neighborhood of the Afghan capital. Those blasts killed at least 85 people, including many children, Afghan officials said.<br />While mosques attended by members of the country’s Shiite minority have been repeatedly targeted by the regional Islamic State affiliate and other militants, Friday’s was the first such attack on a Sunni place of worship in months.<br />Afghans increasingly fear the U.S. military withdrawal, slated to be completed by September, could tip the country into a renewed conflict along sectarian lines."
