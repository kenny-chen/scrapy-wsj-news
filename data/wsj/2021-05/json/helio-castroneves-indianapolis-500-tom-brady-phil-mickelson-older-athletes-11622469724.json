    "body": "What’s getting into our great sports geezers?<br />In February, Tom Brady led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a Super Bowl title at age 43, his second championship in his 40s, and his seventh overall. The win also minted Tampa Bay head coach Bruce Arians as the oldest head coach to win a Super Bowl, at age 68.<br />Then, last weekend, a fit, 50-year-old Phil Mickelson went out and pocketed the PGA Championship, outdueling golf’s thick-shouldered rocket-hitters to become the sport’s oldest major tournament winner.<br />Finally, on Sunday, Helio Castroneves cannily passed 24-year-old Alex Palou with two laps to go to win the Indianapolis 500—at age 46.<br />In victory, Castroneves cited Brady and Mickelson as inspirations."
