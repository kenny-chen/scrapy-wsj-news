    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden intends to nominate veteran diplomat and Wall Street executive Thomas Nides to become the next ambassador to Israel, a U.S. official said.<br />The nomination would come as the Biden administration looks to restore good will with the Palestinians and provide aid to help rebuild Gaza after the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas.<br />Mr. Nides, currently the vice chairman of  Morgan Stanley ,  served as a deputy secretary of state under President Barack Obama and is a close adviser to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He has long been considered a leading candidate for the role, a political appointment often held by a close ally to the president.<br />If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Nides would arrive in Israel at a time of growing tension between Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel and political upheaval that prompted four elections in two years, and in the aftermath of a conflict with Hamas that killed more than 250 people, mostly in Gaza.<br />Mr. Nides and the White House didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment."
