    "body": "Boeing Co.  received approval from U.S. air-safety regulators for fixes to an electrical problem that has grounded more than 100 of its 737 MAX jets, the company and a Federal Aviation Administration official said, paving the way for airlines to return them to passenger service within days.<br />The regulatory approval helps to end the latest embarrassing episode for Boeing, which has been grappling with a series of engineering and quality problems that have affected various aircraft. It is also likely to ease frustrations among airlines that had planned to use their 737 MAX planes as travel demand picks up, following a sharp decline due to the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Once the electrical fixes are completed, the 109 affected jets, or about a quarter of the global MAX fleet, will be able to return to passenger service after being grounded since early April, according to industry and FAA officials. The fixes outlined in service bulletins to airlines are expected to take a few days per plane to complete, Boeing executives have said.<br />U.S. airlines have been hoping to have their grounded MAX jets flying again by Memorial Day weekend, in time for the busy summer travel season, industry officials said.<br />Late Wednesday, a Boeing spokeswoman said the company would work with airlines to complete the repairs while it prepares to resume deliveries."
