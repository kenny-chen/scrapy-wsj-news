    "body": "Companies including AT&T Inc.,  Coca-Cola Co .  and others together pay more than $200 million every year to associate their brands with the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Their sponsorship fees give them the exclusive right to associate with 90 NCAA sports championships.<br />Yet the big sponsorship dollars aren’t helping any of the sports except one—Division I men’s basketball—prove the commercial worth of their championship events and attract new investment that could expand their audiences.<br />That’s because the corporate sponsorship dollars aren’t paid to the NCAA at all. Instead, a decade ago the NCAA handed off its sponsorship program to CBS and Turner Sports as part of the broadcasting deal for the men’s basketball tournament.<br />CBS and Turner make a fixed annual payment—currently $850 million—to the NCAA that increases each year. The networks make most of their money from that deal by selling ads for the men’s basketball tournament.<br />But they also control the rights to sell sponsorships for all NCAA-run sports championships—a sideline that this year brought in roughly $211 million, according to an estimate by the IEG Sponsorship Intelligence Database. As stipulated in the NCAA contract, CBS and Turner keep that sponsorship revenue."
