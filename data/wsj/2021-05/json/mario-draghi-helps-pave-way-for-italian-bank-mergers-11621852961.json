    "body": "When Mario Draghi ran the European Central Bank, he pushed, unsuccessfully, to get the region’s feeble banks to merge and clean themselves up.<br />Now as Italy’s prime minister, he is trying again, hoping to spur a consolidation wave among the country’s beleaguered lenders. Italy’s banking sector, stuffed with soured loans and weighed down by high costs, has long loomed as the weakest link among countries that share the euro currency.<br />Last week Mr. Draghi’s government simplified procedures for banks to benefit from tax breaks when they merge, effectively giving them more time to access these benefits.<br />The move is raising expectations among Italian bank executives for mergers to come. Also helping: an economy bouncing back from the pandemic and M&A banking veteran Andrea Orceltaking the helm last month at  UniCredit  SpA, the country’s second-largest bank.<br />“There is a very favorable context so I think that in the next 12 months we could see more transactions,” said Alberto Nagel, chief executive of investment bank Mediobanca SpA."
