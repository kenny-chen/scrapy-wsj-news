    "body": "The Biden administration named Richard Cordray, the former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to oversee the $1.6 trillion federal student-loan program.<br />Mr. Corday will join the administration as chief operating officer of Federal Student Aid, the Education Department agency that manages the loan program, the department said Monday.<br />The position, which doesn’t require Senate confirmation, has traditionally been more of an operational role than a political one. The Federal Student Aid office oversees contracts with private and nonprofit groups that provide customer service for and collect payments from the roughly 43 million Americans with federal student debt. While he was at the CFPB, Mr. Cordray regulated those firms, known as the loan servicers.<br />In 2012, Mr. Cordray became the first head of the CFPB, a watchdog created by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis to regulate lenders and other companies tied to consumer finance. An Obama appointee, he left the agency in 2017, after the Trump administration took office.<br />“Rich was a fearless and effective leader at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau where he held big banks accountable and forced financial institutions to return $12 billion directly to the people they cheated,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), who conceived of the CFPB’s founding, said in a written statement. “I’m very glad he will get to apply his fearlessness and expertise to protecting student loan borrowers and bringing much needed accountability to the federal student loan program.”"
