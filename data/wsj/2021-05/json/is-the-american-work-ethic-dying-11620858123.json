    "body": "Joe Biden likes to say, “It’s simple.” Sometimes, it isn’t.<br />This week, surveying the gulf between the millions of jobs available in the U.S. and the startlingly smaller number of people taking them, President Biden said, “People will come back to work if they’re paid a decent wage.”<br />But what if he’s wrong? What if his $300 unemployment insurance bonus on top of the checks sent directly to millions of people (which began during the Trump presidency) turns out to be a big, long-term mistake?<br />It’s now clear that Mr. Biden and the left expect these outlays effectively to raise the minimum wage by forcing employers to compete with Uncle Sam’s money. Still, it is impossible not to be struck by how many employers say that former and prospective employees—after a year of forced unemployment—simply will not work.<br />Greg Brown, president of W.W. Cannon in Dallas, told the Journal that despite offering wages up to $30 an hour, “you just can’t find people; people aren’t willing to come to work.”"
