    "body": "HSBC Holdings  PLC will stop serving mass-market individual customers and smaller businesses in the U.S., as the bank shifts its focus to wealth management and international banking, especially in Asia.<br />The bank said late Wednesday that it will sell 90 of its 148 branches in the U.S., and plans to wind down another 35 to 40.  HSBC  agreed to sell parts of its business to two U.S. regional banks,  Citizens Financial Group Inc.’s  Citizens Bank and  Cathay General Bancorp ’s  Cathay Bank.<br />HSBC will retain around two dozen locations and convert the sites into international wealth centers, it said. That would help the bank focus on the “banking and wealth-management needs of globally connected affluent and high-net-worth clients,” it added. It will go from about 1.4 million customers to roughly 300,000.<br />As such, the bank will no longer service customers with balances below $75,000. It will also cut ties with all of its retail-business banking customers, meaning small businesses with turnover of $5 million or less, it said.<br />“This next chapter of HSBC’s presence in the U.S. will see the team focus on our competitive strengths, connecting our global wholesale and wealth-management clients to other markets around the world,” HSBC Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn said in prepared remarks. He said the bank’s U.S. mass retail operations “are good businesses, but we lacked the scale to compete.”"
