    "body": "A high-school student’s death in southwestern China has set off a wave of public outrage on social media over control of information in a country subject to some of the world’s heaviest surveillance.<br />The student died on Sunday evening shortly after falling from a building on the campus of No. 49 High School in the city of Chengdu, according to statements by local authorities and state media reports. The reports identified the 16-year-old only by his surname, Lin.<br />The death in Chengdu caught public attention after a person claiming to be the student’s mother posted messages on China’s  Twitter -like Weibo platform, accusing the school of first refusing to show her surveillance footage and later showing her only some of it.<br />“This morning I went to see the surveillance,” read one post published on Monday. “The only thing missing was the moment of the incident.”<br />The account was unverified by Weibo, making it difficult to confirm it was his mother. Several posts on the account featured images of a school-age boy. One showed a woman seated on the ground in front of the school gate cradling a photo of the same child. Multiple efforts to reach the account owner through Weibo and a phone number listed on the account were unsuccessful."
