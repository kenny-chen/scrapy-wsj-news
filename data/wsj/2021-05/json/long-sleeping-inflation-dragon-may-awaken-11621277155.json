    "body": "As Christian Broda and Stanley Druckenmiller eloquently argue, the Federal Reserve is still fighting a problem that is largely ceasing to exist (“The Fed Is Playing With Fire,” op-ed, May 11). The economy is rebounding sharply and signs of rampant inflation are ubiquitous. In every conference call I listened to after first-quarter earnings, companies indicated they are seeing inflation in costs not seen in many years and have been reasonably successful in passing them on. Frequently cited are raw material costs, especially metals, transportation costs and supply-chain issues that have boosted costs. Unlike at the turn of the century when the costs of products were falling because of cheap imports, the reverse is happening. This will be the case for quite a while as more and more corporations diversify away from China to countries with higher costs.<br />Once the inflation surge begins, it feeds on itself as management seeks to get ahead of the curve and raise prices pre-emptively. Once accepted by the marketplace, the momentum builds and before too long a spiral gains traction. By continuing an inappropriately loose policy for so long, the Fed increases the chances it will have to slam on the brakes, with investors symbolically flying through the windshield.<br />Caveat emptor.<br />Robert M.
