    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Racism at Chicago’s City Hall” (May 21): Now we go from social distancing to racial distancing, courtesy of Mayor Lori Lightfoot. The justification for this blatantly racist policy is that white reporters simply cannot walk a mile in her boots, and so they must be boycotted. You are correct that the late Sen. Jim Eastland would crack a smile, but I doubt the nine justices of the Supreme Court who decided Brown v. Board of Education would be amused.<br />Tim Kelly<br />Naples, Fla.<br /><br />So the answer to soaring crime rates, Michigan Avenue stores being boarded up, the schools being run by the teachers union and a nearly dead downtown is better messaging by reporters of color. Who knew? The real tragedy is that there are no electable candidates of better quality than Mayor Lightfoot, so the decline of Chicago will continue under her woke rule."
