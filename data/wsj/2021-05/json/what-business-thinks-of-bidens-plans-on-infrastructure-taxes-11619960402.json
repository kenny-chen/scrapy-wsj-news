    "body": "<br />WASHINGTON—Business leaders see much to like—and much that worries them—in President Biden’s first 100 days in office.<br />Executives in manufacturing, automotive, construction and other industries say they see opportunity in the trillions of dollars Mr. Biden wants to spend to build infrastructure, boost domestic manufacturing, and curb greenhouse-gas emissions linked to climate change.<br />That is tempered by wariness over Mr. Biden’s plans to achieve those goals via higher corporate taxes, and expected new regulations on fossil fuels, telecommunications and other industries.<br />Business and industry leaders are also mindful that Mr. Biden hasn’t filled many key oversight jobs, leaving questions about his approach to trade, antitrust and other policies."
