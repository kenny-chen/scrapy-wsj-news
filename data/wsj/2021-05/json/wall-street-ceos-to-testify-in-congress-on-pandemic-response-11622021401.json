    "body": "WASHINGTON—The heads of the six largest U.S. banks are set to testify before Congress, where they likely will face conflicting pressures from Democrats seeking action on racial disparities in lending and Republicans who say banks should avoid taking positions on social issues.<br />In two days of hearings starting Wednesday, CEOs including  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.’s James Dimon,  Citigroup Inc.’s  Jane Fraser and  Wells Fargo  & Co.’s Charles Scharf plan to paint a favorable picture of an industry they say has helped the economy recover from a pandemic-induced recession, according to their prepared remarks.<br />Democrats, led by Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Rep. Maxine Waters of California, are expected to press the executives to commit to supporting minority communities, including by investing in smaller financial firms, such as minority depository institutions.<br />“The pandemic exposed several frailties in the economy and financial system, including pervasive racial inequalities, unequal access to traditional banking products and services and unaddressed systemic risks threatening U.S. financial stability,” staff for Ms. Waters wrote in a memo to the committee Monday.<br />Republicans are expected to ask banks whether they are going too far in their stated support for “stakeholder capitalism.” Mr. Dimon led a group of executives who in 2019 said corporate decisions should take all stakeholders——employees, customers and society at large——into account."
