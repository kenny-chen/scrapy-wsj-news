    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden on Thursday embraced what for more than a year has been a rarity in much of the nation’s capital: a crowded room.<br />For the first time since taking office, Mr. Biden presided over an indoor White House event that featured a large crowd—68 seated guests, along with a couple of dozen staff and journalists.<br />The event—a ceremony in which Mr. Biden signed a bill designed to address a rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans—marked a return to normal after months of tight coronavirus restrictions that kept most visitors out of the White House and a Democratic presidential campaign defined by remote speeches and drive-through rallies.<br />It follows new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated individuals can gather in most indoor settings without masks. The recommendations prompted immediate changes at the White House, with staff removing their masks shortly after the CDC made its announcement last week.<br />The president and other top administration officials are still adjusting to the new CDC guidance and grappling with varying state and local rules as they travel around the country. Mr. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden have all been spotted wearing masks at various points since the guidance was issued."
