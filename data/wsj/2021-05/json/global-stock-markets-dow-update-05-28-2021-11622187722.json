    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged higher ahead of fresh data that are expected to show a jump in inflation in April.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 added 0.3%, indicating that the broad market index could end the week with gains. Tech heavy Nasdaq-100 futures edged up 0.2%.<br />The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, the price index for personal-consumption expenditure, is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. A surge in demand after Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, coupled with supply chain strains, are expected to have led to a rise in prices last month.<br />Investors and central bankers have closely monitored inflation data to see if these pressures are likely to be temporary or long-lasting. Such data will guide whether policy makers relax measures that have helped markets recover from pandemic lows.<br />“We don’t think the Fed’s going to raise rates aggressively. We think they’ll remain behind the curve because they want to help the economy recover,” said Paul Flood, investment manager at Newton Investment Management. “Everybody is expecting inflation in the short term.”"
