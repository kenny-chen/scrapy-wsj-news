    "body": "Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes appeared in a federal courtroom in San Jose, Calif., Tuesday for the first time in more than a year, attending arguments between her lawyers and prosecutors over what evidence jurors can hear at her approaching criminal fraud trial.<br />Ms. Holmes faces criminal charges stemming from the failed blood-testing startup she launched as a Stanford University dropout in 2003 and ran until its dissolution in 2018. Prosecutors allege that she and former Chief Operating Officer Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani deceived investors and patients by promising the company’s blood-testing technology could do more than it actually could.<br />Attorneys for Ms. Holmes argued Tuesday that the U.S. attorney’s office for the Northern District of California had built a sweeping case on anecdotal evidence and urged a federal judge to restrict what prosecutors could present to a jury at a trial scheduled to begin in late August.<br />“This trial is going to be a sprawling mess of irrelevant, prejudicial evidence,” Amy Saharia, a Williams & Connolly LLP partner representing Ms. Holmes, said in court.<br />Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bostic countered that the case wasn’t overly broad and that the indictment alleged Ms. Holmes “defrauded patients by saying tests were accurate and reliable when they weren’t—and she knew it.”"
