    "body": "The European Union fined  UBS Group AG ,  Nomura Holdings Inc.  and  UniCredit  SpA nearly $450 million for illegally colluding on trades in European government bonds.<br />The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said Thursday that traders at seven investment banks updated each other on customer prices and other sensitive information before government bond auctions, breaking rules against anticompetitive behavior.<br />It said the collusion, which was carried out through chat rooms on Bloomberg terminals, took place between 2007 and 2011, including after the global financial crisis when many banks took state bailouts to survive.<br />Swiss giant UBS took the biggest hit, absorbing a €172 million fine, equivalent to $208 million. The penalty could shave $100 million from its second-quarter results, the bank said. UBS previously made a provision covering a portion of the fine. The potential effect on its second quarter depends on whether it decides to appeal and other factors.<br />UBS greatly scaled back its bond trading operations beginning in 2012."
