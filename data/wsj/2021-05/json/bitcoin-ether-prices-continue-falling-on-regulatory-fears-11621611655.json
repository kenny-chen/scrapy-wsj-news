    "body": "Cryptocurrency prices dropped Friday, extending the week’s selloff, after new comments from the Chinese government spurred fears of a regulatory clampdown in a country where most bitcoins are created.<br />Bitcoin fell 12% to $35,263 and ether declined 19% to $2,248.80 as of 5 p.m. ET Friday after China’s government, following a meeting led by Vice Premier Liu He, pledged in a statement to “crack down on bitcoin mining and trading behavior” as part of broader efforts to guard against financial risk. The statement didn’t provide further details.<br />Much of the global supply of bitcoin is created in China, but the industry causes Beijing headaches, both because of the electricity-intensive process to create it and the financial-system risks posed by a volatile investment product authorities can’t control.<br />Before the comments, bitcoin had been trading near $41,000.<br />The timing of China’s statement, late on a Friday evening, and the fact that the meeting was run by Mr. Liu, President Xi Jinping’s right-hand man on the economy, adds teeth to the directive."
