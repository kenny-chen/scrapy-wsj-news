    "body": "When Elon Musk speaks, bitcoin investors listen.<br />The Tesla chief executive’s often-cryptic messages have sent bitcoin’s price on a roller-coaster ride this year. Prices soared nearly 20% one January morning when he added “#bitcoin” to his  Twitter  biography. They jumped 16% in a single day the following month after  Tesla Inc.  revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency.<br />Then, he tweeted earlier this month that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment for its vehicles. Investors widely blame the tweet for starting bitcoin’s most punishing selloff of the year, a rout that has shaved hundreds of billions of dollars off its market capitalization and has erased gains made since early February. After peaking in mid-April near $65,000, bitcoin prices have fallen some 40%, including roughly 30% since Mr. Musk’s May tweet.<br />Many investors were happy to dismiss Mr. Musk’s tweets as harmless noise on the way up. Some investors, particularly newer entrants to the market, even celebrated the fact that Mr. Musk was voicing his support for bitcoin.<br />Now that prices are falling, they are less amused."
