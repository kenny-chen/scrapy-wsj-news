    "body": "FedEx Corp.  is struggling to deliver packages on time, according to industry data, as a pandemic-fueled increase of online orders continues to tax the delivery giant’s network.<br />From March through mid-April, about 87% of FedEx Ground shipments arrived on time, compared with 95% for the similar service at  UPS ,  according to ShipMatrix Inc., a software provider that crunches parcel shipping data. The delays are frustrating customers, some of whom say they have turned to other shippers to fulfill orders.<br />The pandemic has accelerated the shift to e-commerce by years, filling the streets of America with delivery trucks. FedEx and United Parcel Service Inc. handled a record number of parcels last year even as  Amazon.com Inc.  is increasingly delivering its own packages.<br />“FedEx continues to experience a peak-like surge in package volume due to the explosive growth of e-commerce,” a company spokeswoman said in a statement. Despite this pressure, the average transit time for all FedEx Ground shipments delivered in the past six months was just 2.2 days.<br />“As always, we are working closely with our customers to manage their volume and identify opportunities to help ensure the best possible service,” the spokeswoman said."
