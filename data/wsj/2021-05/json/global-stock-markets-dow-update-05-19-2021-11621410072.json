    "body": "U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday, signaling that the major indexes will extend losses as investors await minutes of the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary-policy meeting.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 declined 0.8% and contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.6%. Futures on the Nasdaq-100 fell 1.2%, suggesting technology stocks will be among the biggest losers when markets open.<br />The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.660%, from 1.641% Tuesday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.<br />Stocks have wobbled in recent days amid concerns that higher inflation will prompt the Fed to unwind some of the support it has doled out to markets since early 2020. Fed officials have pushed back against that prospect, saying the economy is still in recovery mode and requires near-zero interest rates along with $120 billion a month in bond purchases.<br />“The key driver now is the central banks,” said Nadège Dufossé, head of cross-asset strategy at Candriam. She expects the Fed to hold off on providing guidance about tapering stimulus until September, by which time data should give a clearer picture of the outlook for inflation."
