    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged up Friday ahead of fresh data on manufacturing and services sectors that will provide more insights into the pace of the economic recovery.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked up 0.3%, suggesting that the broad market gauge may end the week on a tepid note after dropping 0.4% by the close on Thursday. Nasdaq-100 futures edged 0.2% higher Friday, pointing to big technology stocks sealing their best week since mid April.<br />Stocks have ground lower this week on mounting concern that inflation will rise and remain elevated as the economy rebounds. Sentiment reversed on Thursday after initial jobless claims, seen as a proxy for layoffs, fell to a new pandemic low. Investors have poured back into risky assets including growth stocks and cryptocurrencies, prompting prices to rebound from the week’s lows.<br />“There was some relief that the labor market recovery is under way in the U.S. and we’re seeing some nervousness about inflation ebbing away,” said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.<br />Some money managers are betting that some sectors—such as banking and energy—could benefit in particular as the economy rebounds to pre-pandemic levels."
