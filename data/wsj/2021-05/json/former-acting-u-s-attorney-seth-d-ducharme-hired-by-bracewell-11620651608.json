    "body": "Seth D. DuCharme, a Justice Department veteran who led the federal prosecutor’s office in Brooklyn through much of a tumultuous 2020, has joined the law firm Bracewell LLP as a partner.<br />Mr. DuCharme, who also served as a top adviser to then-Attorney General William Barr, will be part of Bracewell’s government enforcement and investigations practice starting Monday, the firm said. Mr. DuCharme left his position as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York in March.<br />Mr. DuCharme said he expected to focus on the complex international matters that he specialized in during a government career that began in Brooklyn in 1996 with the U.S. Marshals Service, tracking down fugitives overseas.<br />In 2008, Mr. DuCharme became an assistant U.S. Attorney in New York’s Eastern District, which includes Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. One of his biggest cases involved two young men from Brooklyn who became radicalized online, traveled to Egypt and planned to attack U.S. servicemen overseas. The prosecution, culminating in a 2011 trial, began what Mr. DuCharme called a “love affair with counterterrorism.”<br />He went on to lead the office’s national-security and cybercrime section, where he created an intervention program for terrorism suspects that has since expanded nationally."
