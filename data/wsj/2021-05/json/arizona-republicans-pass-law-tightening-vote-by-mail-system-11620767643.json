    "body": "Republican lawmakers in Arizona passed a law that creates a new way to remove voters from a list of people who automatically get mail ballots, marking another front in a nationwide fight over voting rules following the 2020 election.<br />GOP Gov. Doug Ducey swiftly signed the new measure shortly after it passed the Senate Tuesday, saying it is about election integrity. “Not a single Arizona voter will lose their right to vote as a result of this new law,” Mr. Ducey said upon signing the legislation.<br />Democrats oppose the bill, but Republicans control both legislative chambers in Arizona by narrow margins. GOP lawmakers say creating a new mechanism to remove names from what has been known as the permanent early voting list will help keep the list up-to-date, accounting for things like deaths and people moving out of state.<br />The measure would stop ballots being automatically mailed to voters if they don’t vote on an early ballot in two consecutive election cycles. Proponents of the new law said the voters would remain registered to vote and would be warned before being pulled from the list.<br />“We’re not going to back down from something that’s reasonable, that is common sense and protects the integrity of our elections,” said Republican state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who sponsored the bill, at a recent news conference."
