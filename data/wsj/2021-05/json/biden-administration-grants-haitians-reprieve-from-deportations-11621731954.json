    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is offering deportation protections to about 150,000 Haitians living in the U.S. illegally, amid worsening political and civil unrest on the island nation and calls from immigrant advocates to halt deportations there.<br />“Haiti is currently experiencing serious security concerns, social unrest, an increase in human rights abuses, crippling poverty, and lack of basic resources,” said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in a statement Saturday.<br />The designation of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, by the Department of Homeland Security will grant Haitians in the U.S. work permits and shield them from deportation for 18 months, a term that can be renewed.<br />About 100,000 Haitians are currently living in the U.S. without permission, DHS estimates, and they will be eligible to receive temporary immigration protections under the program so long as they were present in the U.S. as of Friday.<br />In addition, 54,000 Haitians were previously granted TPS. Their protections from deportation will be extended."
