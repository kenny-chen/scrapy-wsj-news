    "body": "Paris<br />A new museum down the street from the Louvre is being unveiled along with some historical baggage that reflects how France is acknowledging and re-evaluating its colonialist history.<br />The Bourse de Commerce, a Belle Epoque rotunda that housed the commodities exchange of Paris during the 19th and 20th centuries, has been renovated and revitalized for the 21st. Its new tenant—with a 50-year lease on the space—is the Pinault Collection, home to the contemporary art of François Pinault. The French billionaire, whose family owns brands including Gucci and Saint Laurent, commissioned Japanese architect Tadao Ando to provide a dash of radical minimalism to the building’s ornate interior.<br />The last time the Bourse was overhauled on this scale was in 1889 for the World’s Fair. That’s when the Eiffel Tower was completed, cementing Paris’s status as the center of the Western world.<br />Undergirding this march of progress was a period of aggressive colonial expansion that secured France’s trade routes and, in turn, fueled the Bourse’s frenetic trading floor. It was here that cocoa, sugar, coffee and other commodities from around the world were priced for Western consumption."
