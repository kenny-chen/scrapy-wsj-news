    "body": "Rich Lesser, the chief executive officer of Boston Consulting Group, gathered with his executives Friday in the wake of the CDC’s new guidance that says vaccinated Americans no longer need to wear masks and observe social distancing in most instances.<br />At issue is whether the relaxed rules change how quickly BCG and other companies should bring workers back into skyscrapers from Manhattan to San Francisco.<br />“It was a surprising decision,” Mr. Lesser said of the new federal guidelines. He said BCG executives would be holding more meetings to think through the company’s plans on Sunday and Monday.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated guidance on Thursday threw a new wrinkle into reopening plans, raising questions about whether to speed up office-return dates. Whether companies change course quickly depends, in part, on local laws governing office capacity and masks, as well as the comfort level of employees being asked to return, executives said.<br />Some retailers made a switch on Friday.  Walmart Inc.  said it would no longer require vaccinated workers and shoppers to wear masks in stores and warehouses outside of municipalities that require it, and  Costco Wholesale Corp.  announced a similar policy."
