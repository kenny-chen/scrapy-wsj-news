    "body": "In the opening rounds of the NHL playoffs, the hottest player on the hottest team has been Colorado’s Nathan MacKinnon. Already one of the league’s top scorers over the last four seasons, the 24-year-old center has taken his game to another level in May and is racking up points at the most efficient clip of any skater in the 2021 postseason.<br />MacKinnon was key to Colorado’s opening round sweep of the St. Louis Blues and added another three points in Sunday’s 7-1 blowout of Las Vegas in Game 1 of the West Division final.<br />But it’s not just his scoring prowess that is propelling the Avalanche. He is also helping Colorado challenge for its first championship since 2001 with his contract. As the 79th highest-paid player in 2021, MacKinnon is the biggest bargain in professional hockey, allowing Colorado’s front office to build a deep bench around him for this year’s Cup run.<br />How it happened is partly a reflection of the NHL’s changing labor market dynamics and partly luck.<br />MacKinnon was the top pick in the 2013 NHL draft at 17 years old, won the Calder Trophy, awarded to the NHL’s rookie of the year, in 2013-14 and showed flashes of brilliance in subsequent seasons. As a sophomore he netted 38 points in 64 games and added 52 more in 72 contests heading into his contract year."
