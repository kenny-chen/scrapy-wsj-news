    "body": "The soaring lumber costs that have slowed construction of single-family homes are starting to pinch apartment-building developers too.<br />While many multifamily buildings are made of steel, glass and concrete, wood is also a major component, especially in low- and mid-rise buildings. Wood is also used extensively for floors, cabinets and other fixtures.<br />As a result, multifamily developers like Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC and Trammell Crow Residential indicated they are experiencing the same sticker shock that is hitting home builders. Even many homeowners are feeling it when they visit their local hardware stores to buy lumber. Prices are near record territory and more than three times what they were at this time last year, according to industry executives.<br />The cost of softwood lumber, which is often used for framing, is now at a record, up over 83% from this time last year, according to CoStar Advisory Services. Overall, lumber and wood prices are also at record levels, up 34% from one year ago, CoStar said.<br />Material costs included in new multifamily construction are up 25% to 30% over the past year, according to CoStar. That increase—not just in prices for lumber but for other commodities like fuel, copper and steel—was the largest since at least 1988, CoStar said."
