    "body": "The New York attorney general’s office has said it is criminally investigating former President Donald Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, after at least two years of pursuing a civil probe.<br />The attorney general’s investigation has been probing alleged financial misconduct similar to that being looked at by the Manhattan district attorney’s office. Two assistant attorneys general will join Manhattan prosecutors in their continuing criminal probe, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Here’s what we know about the investigations.<br />The two offices have been investigating the Trump Organization for several years, and have likely collected reams of material about the company. Joining forces allows them to work together on what the district attorney’s office has called a complex financial investigation.<br />The two new prosecutors add additional firepower to the investigation. These two assistant attorneys general can participate in grand jury proceedings and handle material protected by secrecy rules without an order from a judge."
