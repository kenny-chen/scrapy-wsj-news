    "body": "TOKYO—A handful of athletes from as far away as the U.S. and the U.K. came to Tokyo for a track and field competition Sunday that served as a rare on-site test for a pandemic-constrained Olympics.<br />Nine athletes who live outside Japan were granted an exception and permitted to enter the country, which is generally closed to visitors. Their movements were limited to their lodging and the National Stadium, which was empty except for staff and journalists.<br />“This is not under any circumstances business as usual,” said Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics, the global track and field governing body. Athletes accept “that there are sacrifices they’re going to have to make,” he said.<br />The event comes less than three months before the Games are scheduled to begin on July 23. Demonstrators outside the stadium called for the Games to be canceled amid a surge of new coronavirus cases in Japan.<br />American sprinter Justin Gatlin, who eked out a victory in the 100 meters with a time of 10.24 seconds, said he understood the concerns but thought the Olympics could go ahead safely."
