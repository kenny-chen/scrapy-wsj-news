    "body": "TOKYO—Opposition to the Tokyo Olympics opening in two months has deepened in Japan and spread to some prominent business leaders despite organizers highlighting recent warm-up events as evidence that the Games can safely go ahead.<br />On Sunday, Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of technology investment company  SoftBank Group Corp. , painted a scenario in which arriving athletes and officials triggered a new wave of infections with virus variants, leading to deaths, more emergency shutdowns and further shrinkage of Japan’s economy.<br />Canceling the Games might bring financial losses, but by holding them, Mr. Son wrote on Twitter,  “I think we’re going to lose something much bigger.”<br />Hiroshi Mikitani, the chief executive of e-commerce company  Rakuten Group Inc.,  said in a recent interview with CNN that the Olympics were a “suicide mission.”<br />Olympic organizers say the event won’t be canceled. On Friday, John Coates, the head of the International Olympic Committee’s coordination commission for the Tokyo Olympics, said around 80% of athletes and officials were set to be vaccinated, and strict restrictions on movement would prevent contact with the public."
