    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden revoked several of former President Donald Trump’s executive actions, including one requiring green-card applicants abroad to show they can afford healthcare and another protecting U.S. monuments from damage.<br />The healthcare order never took effect, due to continuing litigation, so like a number of the orders that Mr. Biden revoked Friday, it ended up being largely symbolic.<br />Mr. Trump’s order regarding green-card applicants was issued in October 2019 and would have required that applicants abroad show they have either a healthcare plan or the financial means to afford coverage before being admitted to the U.S.<br />The requirement would have affected prospective immigrants with limited income, particularly from regions where salaries routinely fall below the U.S. poverty level, who otherwise qualified to move to the U.S. The order was in line with a broader Trump administration push to ensure that immigrants moving to the U.S. wouldn’t burden the American healthcare system or public welfare programs.<br />About two weeks before Mr. Biden took office, the policy was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The lawsuit continued once Mr. Biden took office, but would likely be rendered moot by the revocation of the order."
