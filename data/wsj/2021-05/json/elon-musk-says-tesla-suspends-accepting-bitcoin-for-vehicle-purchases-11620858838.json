    "body": "Tesla Inc.  Chief Executive Elon Musk said the company has suspended accepting bitcoin as payment for its vehicles.<br />“We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal,” Mr. Musk said Wednesday on Twitter.<br />Bitcoin’s value against the dollar fell more than 5% after Mr. Musk’s tweet.<br />Tesla earlier this year began to accept the cryptocurrency as payment for products sold in the U.S. The company also made a big financial bet on bitcoin when it bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency in the first quarter. Tesla has since sold some of those holdings, a move that boosted first-quarter earnings.<br />Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn has said the company opted to invest in bitcoin when it was looking for a place to store cash it didn’t immediately need as a way to preserve liquidity while also earning a return."
