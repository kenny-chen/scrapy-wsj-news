    "body": "Ellen DeGeneres said she will end her long-running daytime talk show after a nearly two-decade run that established the comedian as an iconic figure in television.<br />Producer Warner Bros. Unscripted Television confirmed the show’s ending. Warner Bros. is part of AT&T Inc.<br />“Although all good things must come to an end, you still have hope that the truly great things never will,” Mike Darnell, president of Warner Bros. Unscripted Television, said in a statement. “It was and is an indelible piece of the television landscape, and it will be sorely missed.”<br />Ms. DeGeneres told The Hollywood Reporter the next season, her 19th, will be her last. She said she is looking for a new challenge.<br />Known for a mix of celebrity interviews, lighthearted games and occasional dancing, Ms. DeGeneres’s show has been a fixture in daytime TV."
