    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration moved to sharply ramp up Covid-19 vaccine shipments to other countries, following calls for the U.S. to bolster efforts to curb the coronavirus globally as it rages unchecked in developing nations.<br />An earlier pledge to export 60 million doses of the vaccine from  AstraZeneca  PLC came with little sacrifice because that vaccine has yet to be authorized for U.S. use. The U.S. now plans to share globally 20 million doses of vaccines produced by  Moderna Inc.,   Pfizer  Inc.  and  Johnson & Johnson ,  all of which are being used in the U.S.<br />President Biden said Monday that 80 million vaccine doses are expected to be donated by the end of June. Delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccine doses will be contingent on a Food and Drug Administration review of product-quality standards, the White House said.<br />“We know America can never be fully safe until the pandemic that’s raging globally is under control,” Mr. Biden said.<br />The U.S. has faced criticism both at home and abroad for policies that prioritized the vaccination of Americans, in part through contracts that required vaccine makers to deliver most initial production to the U.S. government."
