    "body": "Tribune Publishing Co. said Friday that its shareholders voted to approve a takeover offer from Alden Global Capital LLC, amid confusion over the vote of a key shareholder, in a deal that hands control of nine large daily newspapers to a hedge fund with a reputation for aggressive cost cutting.<br />Owners of Tribune shares agreed to accept Alden’s buyout offer that values the company at $635 million, a company representative said on a call Friday with shareholders. The hedge fund had previously amassed an approximately 32% stake in Tribune, whose properties include the Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News, in late 2019 and eventually secured three of the company’s seven board seats.<br />The success of the deal with Alden had hinged on the vote of biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times and holder of an approximately 24% stake in Tribune. Mr. Soon-Shiong said in a statement that he had opted to abstain from Friday’s vote, generating confusion among shareholders, Tribune employees and others watching the deal over whether Alden’s bid had enough support to pass.<br />Tribune’s announcement that the bid had passed came after the deal received support from more than two-third of the shares not owned by Alden, as was required. Mr. Soon-Shiong’s shares were among those that voted in favor of the deal, people familiar with the matter said, despite his statement about his vote.<br />Mr. Soon-Shiong didn’t immediately respond to requests for additional comment."
