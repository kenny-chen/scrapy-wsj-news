    "body": "Germany and France welcomed the Biden administration’s new acceptance of a minimum corporate tax rate as low as 15%, possibly smoothing the way to a global agreement as soon as July that could transform how international businesses are taxed.<br />The Treasury’s new position, announced Thursday, would see businesses pay a minimum tax rate of 15% on their overseas profits, below the 21% level it has been seeking for U.S.-based companies’ foreign income.<br />At a meeting of European Union finance ministers Thursday, Germany and France expressed enthusiasm for the plan. The two governments backed the higher rate, but indicated that the lower rate would find wider support among smaller countries.<br />“This is really a big progress,” said Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister. “I’m now very happy that we will have the chance that this deal we are working on for so long can happen in the summer.”<br />“We can live with 15%,” said his French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire."
