    "body": "Veterans are understandably weary of American efforts in Afghanistan, but there are a few critical lessons we should keep in mind (“Vets See Echoes of Vietnam in Afghanistan Withdrawal Plan,” Page One, April 27).<br />We were at least as weary when we withdrew from Iraq in 2011, but the rise of Islamic State three years later and its ensuing wave of terrorist attacks showed that our departure had been too hasty. The U.S. was forced to send combat forces back into a much more complicated, hostile situation over a broader area. In the end, our departure cost us more than simply remaining would have. Although withdrawal from Afghanistan may be inevitable, we might yet avoid total failure. A little political will can go a long way.<br />None of this excuses the hasty decision for war with Iraq in 2003 or the frequently incomprehensible manner in which we operated in Iraq and Afghanistan. History will assign blame for those mistakes, but our task today is to avoid new ones. If we aren’t willing to use a modicum of blood and treasure to maintain an unpalatable but necessary effort in Afghanistan today—or at the very least to aid a friendly government under threat—there is a good chance we will spend far more in the future.<br />Ben Lowsen<br />Alexandria, Va."
