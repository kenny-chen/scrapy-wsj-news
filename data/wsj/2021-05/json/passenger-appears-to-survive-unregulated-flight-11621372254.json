    "body": "Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D., Mich.) has taken a back seat to no one in regulating the daily lives of citizens during the era of Covid-19. She’s even trying to make some emergency workplace rules permanent in the Wolverine State. But for her own life, it seems Gov. Whitmer is not exactly a fanatic about following rules when she’s in the passenger seat.<br />Recently this column noted Ms. Whitmer’s decision to ignore her own warnings against out-of-state travel. Now there are more questions about her mode of transportation. Paul Egan reports for the Detroit Free Press from Lansing:<br />This new level of controversy relates to questions of both regulation and financing. Mr. Egan reports:<br />As for the financing, the $27,521 trip was funded by a nonprofit organization controlled by Ms. Whitmer called Michigan Transition 2019, with Ms. Whitmer herself pitching in a token $855, the estimated price of a comparable first-class seat.<br />There’s also more news on Ms. Whitmer’s rejection of her own government’s travel advisory. It’s not just an issue of deciding to fly to Florida—which she has singled out as a travel risk—but also her government’s guidance on what to do in the event of such travel."
