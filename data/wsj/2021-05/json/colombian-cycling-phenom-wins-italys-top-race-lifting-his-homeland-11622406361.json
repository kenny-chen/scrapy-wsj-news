    "body": "ZIPAQUIRÁ, Colombia—As his homeland struggles with a surge in Covid-19 deaths, a tanking economy and clashes between protesters and antiriot police, cycling phenomenon Egan Bernal has provided his fellow Colombians with a more rose-colored view of their nation.<br />Bernal, who in 2019 became the first Colombian to win the Tour de France, on Sunday won his sport’s second-most important stage race, the three-week-long Giro d’Italia, and claimed its pink champion’s jersey, known as the maglia rosa.<br />“This is something that Colombia needed, given all that has happened to the country,” said David Ortiz, a circus performer who biked to Bernal’s hometown of Zipaquirá, near the capital of Bogotá, to watch Sunday’s final stage on a widescreen television at a crowded outdoor plaza.<br />Indeed, Bernal’s triumph was a rare bit of good news amid the helter-skelter of Colombia, where nearly five weeks of antigovernment protests sparked by economic misery have led to at least 25 deaths, road blockades that have paralyzed the economy and the torching of government offices and police stations.<br />What rights groups assert is disproportionate police force against demonstrators has prompted an international outcry, reams of bad press for Colombia and even calls for President Iván Duque to resign. All this comes as Colombia is logging one of the world’s highest per capita Covid-19 death rates."
