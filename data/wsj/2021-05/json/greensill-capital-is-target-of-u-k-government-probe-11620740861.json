    "body": "The U.K.’s top financial regulator said it was investigating failed financial firm Greensill Capital, citing allegations of what it called “potentially criminal” matters.<br />The Financial Conduct Authority said it was collaborating with other U.K. enforcement agencies and authorities overseas as part of its investigation into Greensill’s collapse. The disclosure came in a letter from the FCA to a U.K. parliament committee hearing testimony on Tuesday from Greensill founder Lex Greensill.<br />Mr. Greensill made his first public comments since the firm tumbled into bankruptcy in March, saying he bears complete responsibility for the company’s collapse. “To all of those affected by this, I am truly sorry,” he said.<br />A representative for the company declined to comment on the FCA’s investigation.<br />Founded by Australian-born Mr. Greensill, the company billed itself as a technology startup that competed with traditional banks such as  Citigroup Inc.  and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Greensill’s goal was to offer supply-chain finance to companies that had fallen below the radar of traditional banks that preferred larger, more-established clientele."
