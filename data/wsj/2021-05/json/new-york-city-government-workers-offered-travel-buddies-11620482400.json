    "body": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says that crime on the subway is low, but his office is still launching a travel-buddy program for government employees who feel unsafe commuting to work.<br />The city announced the program in an April 30 email to employees ahead of an estimated 80,000 government workers returning on a rotating schedule to their offices this month. Most municipal offices had been closed over the past year because of Covid-19 lockdown measures.<br />Returning employees have the option of signing up to be matched as travel partners with another worker in their neighborhood, according to the email, which The Wall Street Journal reviewed. A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio said it was too soon to say how many employees signed up for the program.<br />“Our mission is to make New York City safer for everyone; that’s why we have transit officers and mental health teams in the subway system, and that’s why we’re spearheading this effort to make our colleagues feel comfortable after a year away from the office,” the spokesman, Mitch Schwartz, said in a statement.<br />Officials at the state-controlled Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s subway, have spent months calling for more police officers in the system."
