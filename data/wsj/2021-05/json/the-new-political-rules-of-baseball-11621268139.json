    "body": "Remember last month when weak CEOs got bullied by leftists into  condemning Georgia’s sensible voting reforms? The passage of time hasn’t made such corporate gestures any less empty. Take Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, who attempted to signal organizational virtue by announcing he would move this year’s All-Star Game out of Atlanta. Now preparations for the relocated game in Denver, Colorado reveal why he never should have abandoned the Peach State.<br />The leftist canard has been that Georgia’s effort to ensure the integrity of the ballot is akin to the racist Jim Crow laws of years ago. On April 2 Mr. Manfred endorsed this nonsense when he issued the following statement:<br />What restrictions? The law expanded weekend voting and ensured no-excuse absentee voting and drop boxes in every county. It also required proper identification to vote, which is broadly popular in America outside of tweeting leftists and the CEOs who fear them. A Journal editorial noted in March:<br />An April editorial added:<br />Little more than a month after this media storm of distortion, Major League Baseball policy is making it clear just how seriously Mr. Manfred takes this issue. MLB’s current position is that rigorous verification procedures should be reserved—not for elections to choose the people who will govern us—but for other societal activities, such as serving as an unpaid volunteer at baseball’s all-star game."
