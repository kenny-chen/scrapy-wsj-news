    "body": "Aon  PLC and Willis  Towers Watson  PLC on Wednesday agreed to sell a package of assets to a smaller rival in an effort to win antitrust approval for their $35 billion tie-up to create the world’s largest insurance broker.<br />The $3.57 billion deal with  Arthur J. Gallagher  & Co. comes as Aon and Willis are under pressure to address concerns from the European Union’s executive arm around a combination of the No. 2 and No. 3 brokers.<br />The EU fears that, left unchecked, their merger would narrow customer choice and give the combined entity too much sway over prices for helping clients purchase financial protection against property and casualty damages, trade tensions and cybercrime.<br />Together, the companies would have combined revenue of more than $20 billion. That would top  Marsh & McLennan  Cos.’ total of $17.2 billion last year and dwarf the more than $6 billion generated by Gallagher.<br />Aon and Willis, both registered in Ireland, are betting that the asset sales to Gallagher would resolve the European Commission’s issues by allowing the rival broker to expand its business helping insurers buy reinsurance or protection against claims and extend its reach geographically."
