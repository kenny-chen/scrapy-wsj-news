    "body": "President Biden’s coming budget proposal will include his decision on whether to push to end a ban on using federal dollars for abortions in most cases, potentially opening a new front in the clash over access to the procedure.<br />Mr. Biden said during his presidential campaign that he backed scrapping the ban, known as the Hyde Amendment, reversing his longstanding position in favor of the measure that has been included in spending bills for decades.<br />Keeping the language out of his Friday budget proposal would be welcomed by many Democrats and abortion-rights advocates, but eliminating the Hyde Amendment would face headwinds in Congress, where most Republicans are opposed.<br />Mr. Biden’s budget proposal won’t likely be enacted in full by lawmakers, but it serves as a statement of the White House’s priorities. And his decision comes as some states add new restrictions on abortions and the Supreme Court prepares to consider the legality of a Mississippi abortion law that sought to ban the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.<br />The White House declined to discuss the budget but said the president’s position on the Hyde Amendment hasn’t changed since his campaign statements."
