    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />We got a hint that something strange was going on with late-era Van Morrison when he called a 2015 release “Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue.” It found the Northern Irish singer-songwriter revisiting deep cuts from earlier in his career with partners like Steve Winwood and George Benson, but the album’s title sounded like something scribbled at the top of a recording executive’s marketing memo. It was as if Mr. Morrison was acknowledging that his records were merely contractual obligations. But while the record’s name suggested a lack of inspiration, his actual performances on the collection—and on the six albums he’s put out since—are impassioned and committed. Even when he seems to be going through the motions, his voice, which has held up astonishingly well for someone who is 75 years old, keeps the distinctive spark heard on legendary songs like “Brown Eyed Girl,” “Moondance” and “Jackie Wilson Said (I’m in Heaven When You Smile).”"
