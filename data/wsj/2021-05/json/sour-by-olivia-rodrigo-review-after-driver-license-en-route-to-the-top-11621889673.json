    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Olivia Rodrigo is a little under five months into her solo recording career and she’s already made history. On Jan. 8, she released her debut single, “Drivers License,” a moody ballad about lost love, and it was an instant sensation. It immediately leaped to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for eight weeks—one of only a handful of times an artist’s first single has topped the chart, and the first time one has lasted so long in the pole position. Ms. Rodrigo, who was 17 years old when “Drivers License” came out and turned 18 in February, was already famous to young audiences as an actress in “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” on Disney+. She’d recorded as part of the cast and appeared on the show’s soundtrack album. But her existing celebrity can’t fully account for the runaway success of “Drivers License.” On Spotify, the track is closing in on 800 million streams, an absurdly high number for a song that hasn’t been out for half a year.<br />“Sour” (Geffen/Interscope), Ms. Rodrigo’s debut LP, out now, offers a more complete picture of an artist we’ll be hearing from for a long time. In interviews the singer has characterized herself as a musical omnivore, but the artistic lineage of her own work is well-defined. The songs are mostly ballads, the subject is fleeting romance and the emotional crush of the breakup, and the hushed style is built on intimacy. One of Ms. Rodrigo’s heroes is Taylor Swift, and the influence is obvious even though their music sounds very different. The fourth track here, “1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back,” borrows elements from a composition by Ms. Swift, who with her frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff gets a credit. Vocally, Ms. Rodrigo is indebted to the vowel-mangling indie-pop diction popularized by Australian singer Lorde and the whispered closeness of Billie Eilish."
