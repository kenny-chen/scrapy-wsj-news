    "body": "Images of buildings exploding in Gaza from Israeli airstrikes and the country’s police storming Jerusalem’s Al Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, have catalyzed a wave of pro-Palestinian protests across the Middle East and beyond, testing the limits of Arab governments’ relationships with Israel.<br />Israel had hoped a set of diplomatic agreements struck last year, called the Abraham Accords, would reconfigure its position in a region that has long shunned it, helping the country contain Iran and begin to forge new commercial ties. But now its decades-old struggle with the Palestinians has come to the fore once again.<br />Officials from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco—all countries that normalized ties with Israel in 2020—have criticized Israeli policies this week. Even proponents of the accords recognize the deepening challenge for Israel to win acceptance in a region where its occupation of Palestinian territory is deeply unpopular.<br />“Israel right now is putting its friends and partners, including the U.A.E., in a difficult situation, an awkward position,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent Emirati political scientist. “I think this will take us back to square zero.”<br />When entering the Abraham Accords last year, Gulf officials had argued that new diplomatic relationships would give their countries more leverage to convince Israel to change its policies toward Palestinians. Even Saudi Arabia was edging toward recognizing Israel as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmansecretly met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But the current crisis has called that argument into question, observers say."
