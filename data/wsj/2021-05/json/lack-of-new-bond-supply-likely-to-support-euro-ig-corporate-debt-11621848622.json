    "body": "0923 GMT - Limited supply of new bonds is likely to support euro-denominated investment-grade corporate bond spreads Monday, says Commerzbank. “Muted primary market activity gave euro investment-grade cash spreads some breathing space [Friday]” and “with most of Europe away and the U.S. data calendar also empty, the more constructive market backdrop could expand today,” says credit strategist Cem Keltek.
