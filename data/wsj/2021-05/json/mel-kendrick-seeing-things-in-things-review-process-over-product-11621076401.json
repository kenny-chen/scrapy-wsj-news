    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Andover, Mass<br />Here on the grounds of the Phillips Academy, while looking at the two large outdoor installations commissioned for “Mel Kendrick: Seeing Things in Things,” an artist accompanying me picked up and gave me a small, weathered tree branch. Shaped like a hand with outstretched fingers, its “palm” was dark and honey-colored and its “back” was bleached almost white. She was illustrating a point about the surprise and unpretentiousness of nature; and offering it as a palate cleanser to the nearly 90 abstract sculptures, most carved out of wood, we had just seen in Mr. Kendrick’s retrospective inside the Addison Gallery of American Art."
