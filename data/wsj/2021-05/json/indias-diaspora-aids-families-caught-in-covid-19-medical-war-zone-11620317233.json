    "body": "The urgent pleas for help from Rohit Mediratta’s family and friends in India began a few weeks ago. Then his brother, a neurosurgeon in New Delhi, said that his hospital had canceled most surgeries after running low on oxygen.<br />Mr. Mediratta, a tech company director of engineering who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., said he and his wife, Kanika, felt compelled to act. She found a supplier of oxygen concentrators, which filter oxygen from the air, that was willing to ship immediately to India. They raised more than half a million dollars from a GoFundMe campaign, and on Tuesday the first batch of 140 concentrators arrived at a field hospital in Delhi.<br />“India is essentially a medical war zone,” Mr. Mediratta said. “It’s heart-wrenching that we can only do so much.”<br />As India struggles with the pandemic’s fastest-growing Covid-19 surge, one of the world’s largest diasporas is mobilizing aid, including many Indian-Americans. On Thursday, India reported more than 412,000 new daily cases, a global single-day high for the pandemic, and nearly 4,000 deaths.<br />There are about four million Americans of Indian descent, and many are donating to nonprofits that are shipping critical medical supplies to India and searching for vendors to send equipment."
