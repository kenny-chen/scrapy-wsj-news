    "body": "Over the years, Aiza Bolo, a 36-year-old housewife in the Philippines, has come to depend on the $550 her stepbrother sent her each month from his job in Dubai.<br />When the pandemic struck and the income from a fruit stand her parents own dried up, her stepbrother began sending as much as $950 a month. That enabled her to keep buying medication for her parents and purchase a laptop and internet connection so that her 13-year-old son could continue his schooling online.<br />“What Justine sends is more than just money. It is a lifeline for us,” Ms. Bolo said. “There was barely any income during the pandemic, so we all relied on him.”<br />Funds that migrant workers send home—known as remittances—have long offered millions in the developing world critical support, paying for needs including schooling, shelter and healthcare for relatives back home.<br />Many of those migrant workers continue to send money back, often despite their own economic difficulties, providing financial cushions in countries where Covid-19 cases are still high, vaccines are slow to arrive and the economy is struggling."
