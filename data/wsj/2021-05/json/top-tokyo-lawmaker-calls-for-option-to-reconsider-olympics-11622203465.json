    "body": "TOKYO—A leading ally of Tokyo’s governor said Japan should retain the option of canceling or postponing the Summer Olympics, one of the first clear voices of doubt about the Games from political figures close to the organizers.<br />Hiroki Masuko, the secretary-general of the largest party in Tokyo’s metropolitan assembly, pushed back on recent suggestions by senior figures in the International Olympic Committee that the Games would open as planned on July 23 regardless of developments before then.<br />“To ensure we protect the lives and livelihoods of Tokyo residents, we must keep all options available,” Mr. Masuko said in a statement Friday.<br />Mr. Masuko represents the “Tokyo Residents First” party, founded in 2017 by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike. Ms. Koike has consistently said that Tokyo can safely host the Olympics despite widespread public concern about the possible spread of Covid-19.<br />“We both seek a safe and secure Games. There’s no difference between us in that,” Ms. Koike said in response to Mr. Masuko’s statement."
