    "body": "We have all found money in the couch. Now people are mistaking a couch for money.<br />Ethan Allen Interiors ,  a furniture company that definitely won’t let you pay in bitcoin, has seen a surge of retail-investor interest recently. Its ticker symbol, ETH, is the same as the one used for red-hot ethereum. Message boards for the stock are mostly filled with banter about the cryptocurrency, not the company.<br />“We’ve definitely seen a massive increase on a percentage basis in mistaken activity on the Ethan Allen stream,” says Rishi Khanna, Chief Executive Officer of social investing site Stocktwits.<br />The confusion persists despite ribbing by other posters. On Yahoo Finance, for example: “$ETH to the moon!—give us something to sit in when we get there!” And: “In the year 2030, all transactions will be settled digitally with Ethan Allen interiors stock.”<br />With some novice investors buying first and asking questions later, it might even have spilled over into actual purchases. Turnover for Ethan Allen in the past month is 56% above its five-year average. That might not be a bad thing. Back in the dot-com boom, some investors allegedly bought “the wrong  Cisco , ” purchasing shares of food services company  Sysco  by mistake. Since March 2000, it has outperformed the once red-hot networking stock by 728 percentage points."
