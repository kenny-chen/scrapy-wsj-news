    "body": "The slowing growth spurt at  VF Corp.’s  youth-focused Vans brand is drawing some concern. While less exciting, investors should be assured that the company has its adult matters down.<br />In the quarter ended April 3, sales across VF Corp.’s brands increased 19% from a year earlier after stripping out currency fluctuations, a slightly higher number than analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected. For its full fiscal year, revenue from continuing operations declined 14% in constant dollars. That is worse than the 7% top-line decline that industry leader  Nike  saw, but much better than the 29% drop at Ralph Lauren in their comparable periods.<br />All three of its largest brands—Vans, The North Face and Timberland—saw better-than-expected sales largely thanks to strong demand in Asia. In particular, sales of The North Face in the Asia-Pacific region almost doubled on a constant currency basis last quarter.<br />Another bright spot was stronger-than-expected performance at Supreme, VF Corp.’s latest acquisition. In the first quarter in which VF Corp. integrated the brand’s results, it brought in $142 million of revenue, higher than the $125 million that analysts had expected. The company also said Supreme is expected to bring in $600 million in revenue this fiscal year, up almost 20% year over year.<br />Yet VF Corp.’s share prices slid 8% after its earnings call on Friday morning, and are now down about a fifth compared with pre-pandemic levels."
