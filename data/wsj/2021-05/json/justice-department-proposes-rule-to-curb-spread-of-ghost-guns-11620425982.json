    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department proposed a new rule Friday aimed at curbing ghost guns, which lack the serial numbers law enforcement use to track criminals’ weapons.<br />The weapons “are often assembled from kits that are sold without background checks, making them easily acquired by criminals who otherwise would not be permitted to possess a firearm,” the department said.<br />More than 23,000 firearms without serial numbers were recovered by law enforcement from potential crime scenes from 2016 through 2020, the Justice Department said.<br />The agency said the proposed rule would help prevent guns from being sold to felons and others who aren’t permitted to buy guns.<br />“This proposed rule would help keep guns out of the wrong hands and make it easier for law enforcement to trace guns used to commit violent crimes, while protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans,” Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a written statement."
