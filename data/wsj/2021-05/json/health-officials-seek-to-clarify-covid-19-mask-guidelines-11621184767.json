    "body": "U.S. public-health officials tried to address confusion about new masking guidelines released last week, reiterating that vaccinated individuals are at low risk of catching or spreading Covid-19 but leaving the future of mask mandates up to local jurisdictions and private businesses.<br />“This is not permission for widespread removal of masks,” said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky on Sunday on ABC. “We were going to get to the point in the pandemic where the vaccinated could take off their masks.”<br />Dr. Walensky said the CDC’s updated guidance would help communities figure out how to balance safety with reopening, while encouraging people to get vaccinated.<br />Those who aren’t vaccinated should continue to wear their masks and get vaccinated, she said. She urged businesses to make it easy for their employees to get vaccinated.<br />“Give them the time that they need so that they can make those appointments and get themselves vaccinated so those—people in those businesses are safe,” Dr. Walensky said on NBC."
