Japan, the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China, is benefiting from the economic comeback in those two countries, which are also Japan’s two largest trading partners.<br />In the January-March quarter, the Japanese economy shrank 1.3%, in line with consensus forecasts. It shrank 5.1% on an annualized basis, which reflects what would happen if the first-quarter pace continued for a full year. The figure followed growth in the second half of 2020.<br />Private spending fell 1.4% from the previous quarter, the first decline in three quarters, because shops and restaurants closed or operated for shorter hours during the state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka and other areas. It was in place from January through March and was reimposed in late April. Capital expenditures also declined 1.4%.<br />The global economic recovery, propelled by the Covid-19 vaccination rollout in many nations, may help the Japanese economy resume growth in the current quarter by raising demand for goods the country produces such as cars and electronic parts."
