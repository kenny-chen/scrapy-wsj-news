    "body": "Don’t tell Chinese consumers that the shopping mall is in decline.<br />While shoppers on the mainland like to browse for items online, during the pandemic many said they rediscovered the joy of making purchases at bricks-and-mortar stores after being cooped up at home for weeks.<br />China was also the only major economy to report economic growth in 2020 after limiting the spread of the coronavirus early on and allowing people to return to work by midyear. But travel restrictions kept most from going abroad—meaning local shops saw cash that might otherwise have been spent on trips to Europe, Japan or the U.S.<br />In 2019, Chinese consumers spent around €64 billion ($77.3 billion) on luxury goods when traveling abroad, or more than twice the amount they spent at home in mainland China, according to Bain-Altagamma 2020 Worldwide Luxury Market Monitor.<br />Last year, that spending pattern flipped: Chinese purchased €47 billion of luxury goods on the mainland, which was roughly three times what they spent on these goods overseas."
