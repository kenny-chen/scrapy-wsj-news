    "body": "Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, agreed to a cease-fire that began early Friday following pressure from the U.S. and its allies to end 11 days of fighting.<br />The barrages from both sides were the worst since the most recent of three wars between Israel and Hamas in 2014. The fighting—which began on May 10—claimed the lives of more than 200 people, mostly in Gaza.<br />The U.S., along with Egypt, Qatar and several European nations, worked to persuade both Israel and Hamas leaders to end their military campaigns.<br />President Biden said Thursday that he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu six times since the conflict began. “I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity and democracy,” he said.<br />“My administration will continue our quiet, relentless diplomacy toward that end,” he said."
