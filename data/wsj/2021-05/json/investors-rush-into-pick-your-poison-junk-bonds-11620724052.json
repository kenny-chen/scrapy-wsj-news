    "body": "Risky companies are selling junk bonds at a record pace, getting ultralow borrowing costs and increasingly loose borrowing terms, such as “pick-your-poison” clauses.<br />One recent example was the debt package that funded the buyout of Birkenstock GmbH. The maker of frumpy-but-expensive German sandals was taken over in April by the private-equity fund of Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire who controls LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE.<br />Birkenstock recently sold €430 million of CCC rated bonds, equivalent to around $522 million, at the riskier end of the ratings scale. The bonds, sold as part of a debt package, yield just 5.25%, comfortably below prevailing market rates. That is despite the debt being worth 7 times the company’s earnings.<br />The bonds also contain terms that allow the firm to take on extra debt with a pick-your-poison clause, a term coined by research firm Covenant Review to describe a way for borrowers to get around traditional limits on borrowing.<br />The pick-your-poison nickname comes from the fact that both cash being paid to shareholders and extra debt being added to the business could be “poison” for existing lenders, but the clause lets the owners of the company choose between taking a dividend or borrowing more money."
