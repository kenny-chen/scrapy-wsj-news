    "body": "Federal and state officials are working to develop two wind farm sites off the coast of California, which they say could ultimately generate enough electricity to power about 1.6 million homes.<br />One project site would be off the central California coast near Morro Bay, and the other would be in the waters off Humboldt County near the Oregon border. Biden administration officials say they would be the first U.S. commercial-scale wind projects off the Pacific Coast.<br />Wind power is a key part of President Biden’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Soon after taking office, Mr. Biden directed the Interior Department, which controls the use of federal lands, to explore doubling U.S. offshore wind production by 2030.<br />“The offshore wind industry has the potential to create tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs across the nation, while combating the negative effects of climate change,” Secretary of Interior Deb Haaland said in a statement.<br />California Gov. Gavin Newsom said developing offshore wind energy “could be a game changer to achieving California’s clean energy goals.”"
