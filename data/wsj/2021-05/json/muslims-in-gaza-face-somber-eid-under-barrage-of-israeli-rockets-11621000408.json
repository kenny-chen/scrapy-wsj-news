Stores stay open late to sell sweets and festive nuts, and residents crowd the streets as they shop and rush to visit friends and family.<br />This year, Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have shattered one of the holiest holidays in the Muslim calendar, leaving the streets deserted and families huddled in fear.<br />On Thursday, the first of the three-day Eid al-Fitr celebrations, the al-Hussaini family awoke to warnings that the residential building next to them would be imminently targeted. The family of six hurriedly packed before fleeing their home, taking official documents, jewelry, family savings and diapers for their baby.<br />Once on the street, they were surrounded by neighbors still in their nightclothes looking for a way to escape the area.<br />Mohammed al-Hussaini, who dressed hastily in a T-shirt, sweatpants and sandals, stood with his family hoping to hitch a ride to a relative’s house."
