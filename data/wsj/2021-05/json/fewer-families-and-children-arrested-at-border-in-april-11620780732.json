    "body": "The number of migrant families and unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally dropped in April for the first time in nearly a year, according to government data disclosed Tuesday.<br />Customs and Border Protection agents arrested 48,226 migrants traveling as families and 16,933 children who arrived on their own. Arrests for each of those groups of migrants declined by about 10% compared with March.<br />However, arrests of single adults rose by about 11.5% to 108,301. As a result, the number of arrests by CBP ticked up slightly from March, to about 173,400. That means the Biden administration is still on pace to preside over a 20-year high in illegal border crossings by the end of the federal budget year in September.<br />The number of adults crossing is likely lower than the arrest totals because many attempt to cross the border repeatedly after being caught and returned to Mexico.<br />There are likely multiple reasons for Aprilâ€™s dropoff in families and children crossing the border. Significant among them is stepped-up immigration enforcement by Mexico, which has been more carefully policing its southern border with Guatemala as well as common migrant routes through the country, at the behest of the U.S. government."
