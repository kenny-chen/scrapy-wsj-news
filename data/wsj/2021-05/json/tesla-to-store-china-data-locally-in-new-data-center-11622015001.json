    "body": "SHANGHAI— Tesla Inc.  said all data generated from cars it sold in China will be stored in a new data center there.<br />The move by the U.S. electric-car maker follows government and public scrutiny in China of its handling of potentially sensitive data about vehicle users, car performance and geographical information.<br />In March, the Chinese government restricted the use of Tesla cars by military personnel and the staff of some state-owned companies, The Wall Street Journal reported. The restriction came amid concerns that the vehicles’ cameras could be sending information about government facilities back to the U.S.<br />Tesla Chief Executive Elon Muskpromptly denied that the company’s vehicles were being used to spy on China. Tesla subsequently said it would open a Chinese data center by the end of June to ensure that all information is stored locally.<br />“We have established a data center in China to localize data storage and will continue to add more local data centers,” the company said in a statement posted on its official  Twitter -like Weibo social-media account late on Tuesday. “All data generated from the sales of vehicles in the mainland China market will be stored domestically.”"
