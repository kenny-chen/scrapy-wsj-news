    "body": "TEL AVIV—Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Jerusalem on Tuesday said the U.S. will work to expand economic opportunities for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank to help preserve a cease-fire between Israel and the militant group Hamas following 11 days of fighting.<br />“We know that to prevent a return to violence, we have to use the space created to address a larger set of underlying issues and challenges,” Mr. Blinken said alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after the two met. “And that begins with tackling the great humanitarian situation in Gaza.”<br />Mr. Netanyahu said Israel was ready to discuss ways to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the overall Palestinian economy with international cooperation, but warned Israel would respond forcefully if Hamas breaks the cease-fire.<br />Messrs. Blinken and Netanyahu said they also discussed U.S. efforts to return to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, which removed economic sanctions on Iran in return for limits on its nuclear program. The Israeli leader reiterated his opposition to the deal, arguing it won’t be effective in preventing Iran from producing nuclear weapons.<br />This week marks the first Middle East trip as secretary of state for Mr. Blinken, who delayed travel earlier because of the coronavirus pandemic."
