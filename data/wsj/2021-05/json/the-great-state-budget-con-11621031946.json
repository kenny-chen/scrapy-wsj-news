    "body": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday again spun the fiction that states and localities are drowning in red ink. Apparently she missed California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s news that the state has an astonishing $75 billion budget surplus.<br />“During the Great Recession, when cities and states were facing similar revenue shortfalls, the federal government didn’t provide enough aid to close the gap. That was an error,” Ms. Yellen said as she rolled out expansive guidance on how states can use their $350 billion booty from the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion spending bill.<br />“Insufficient relief meant that cities had to slash spending, and that austerity undermined the broader recovery,” she added. “With today’s announcement, we are charting a very different—and much faster—course back to prosperity.”<br />Talk about fighting the last war. Most states and localities were already prospering financially before Democrats handed them $350 billion in direct aid plus $129 billion for schools and tens of billions more for Medicaid, colleges and public transit, among other things, in March. The Census Bureau recently reported that 2020 state and local revenues overall were 3.7% higher than in 2019.<br />Tax revenues have been surging in the first several months of this year, especially in Democratic-leaning states that tax their rich more. New Jersey’s general fund revenues for the fiscal year are running 15% higher than a year ago, letting Gov. Phil Murphy for the first time make his state’s full actuarially required pension payment."
