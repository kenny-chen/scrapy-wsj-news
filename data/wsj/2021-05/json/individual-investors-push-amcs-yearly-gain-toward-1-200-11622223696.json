The rally marks an astounding turnaround for a company that last year was reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and trying to stave off bankruptcy.<br />Once again fueling this week’s rise: enthusiastic individual investors who have banded together on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, in Discord chat rooms and in text chains with friends. Throughout the week, hashtags including #AMCSTRONG and #AMCSqueeze splashed across  Twitter ,  with many predicting more gains ahead.<br />The chatter helped drive $209 million of net inflows from individual investors between Monday and Thursday, according to Vanda Research’s VandaTrack, more than 15 times the amount seen during the same period of April’s final week.<br />AMC’s shares closed Friday down 1.5% after surging as high as 38% earlier in the day. But the loss wasn’t enough to deter individual investors. Across social media, individual traders on Friday afternoon encouraged others to hold their positions."
