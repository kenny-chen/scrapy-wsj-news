    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House slimmed down its infrastructure plan in negotiations with Senate Republicans, lowering its proposed spending on highways and broadband and shifting some programs into other legislation in an effort to kickstart talks.<br />The new proposal puts the overall price tag at $1.7 trillion, down from $2.3 trillion in the initial White House plan but still well above the Republican lawmakers’ $568 billion offer.<br />“In our view, this is the art of seeking common ground,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.<br />In a memo to Senate Republicans, the White House proposed lowering President Biden’s funding request for broadband internet to $65 billion from $100 billion, and for roads, bridges and infrastructure projects to $120 billion from $159 billion. The White House said those numbers more closely align with Senate Republicans’ proposals.<br />It also proposed shifting $480 billion in funding for research, development and manufacturing initiatives into other legislation. But the White House showed no signs of budging on its plan to raise corporate taxes to pay for the program, which Republicans have called a nonstarter."
