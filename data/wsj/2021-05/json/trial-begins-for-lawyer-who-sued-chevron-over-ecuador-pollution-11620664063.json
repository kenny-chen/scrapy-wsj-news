    "body": "NEW YORK—Steven Donziger once stood to gain hundreds of millions of dollars for winning a $9.5 billion environmental-contamination verdict against  Chevron Corp.  in Ecuador.<br />Now, that judgment has been discredited, Mr. Donziger has lost his New York law license, and he is on trial for criminal charges that he flouted a judge’s orders.<br />The contempt-of-court trial that started Monday before U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska is the latest twist in a legal saga involving Chevron and Mr. Donziger that has lasted nearly three decades and spanned the globe.<br />“Steven Donziger…has intentionally and repeatedly disobeyed court order after court order after court order,” Rita Glavin, a private lawyer serving as the prosecutor, said during opening statements Monday.<br />Martin Garbus, an attorney for Mr. Donziger, said in his opening remarks that his client “is innocent of every single charge.” He said the court had greenlighted an intimidation campaign by Chevron against Mr. Donziger."
