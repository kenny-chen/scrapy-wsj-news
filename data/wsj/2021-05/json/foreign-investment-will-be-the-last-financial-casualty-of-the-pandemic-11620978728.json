    "body": "The overall economic story of 2021 is recovery—a multispeed recovery, but a rapid return toward normalcy nonetheless. For foreign direct investment, which was hammered last year, the story will be very different.<br />Foreign direct investment dropped 38% in 2020, to its lowest level since 2005, according to data released last month by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.<br />FDI is particularly sensitive to the ability of investors to travel. Buying shares in a manufacturing firm in a foreign country is one thing. Buying a plot of land, building a facility and running the factory yourself is quite another: FDI cannot fully recover until international travel starts approaching previous levels.<br />For much of developing Asia in particular, that looks to be an achingly distant prospect. Vaccination rates are low even in countries that can easily afford the supply, and travel restrictions look set to be in place throughout the year and likely beyond in many places.<br />So it is perhaps no surprise that recent research on FDI by consulting firm Kearney predicted that FDI volumes won’t reach their peak levels, recorded in 2016, until 2028. Overseas investment was already weak preceding the pandemic, blamed by analysts on escalating protectionism, particularly between the U.S. and China."
