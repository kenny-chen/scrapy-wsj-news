    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Bernie Sanders will no longer try to force a Senate vote aimed at stopping a $735 million weapons sale to Israel, according to an aide to Mr. Sanders.<br />The aide said the senator found out Friday that the State Department had already finalized the sale, and it wasn’t clear if he could have forced a vote to block it.<br />Mr. Sanders (I., Vt.) questioned whether U.S. military aid to Israel was helping to keep the peace in the region or fueling conflict. Last week, he introduced a resolution for a Senate vote to block the sale.<br />The Arms Export Control Act allows Congress to block a planned arms sale through a joint resolution of disapproval, with such measures automatically entitled to a vote on the Senate floor. It takes only a simple majority to pass a disapproval resolution, though it would take a two-thirds majority in each chamber to override a presidential veto.<br />Republicans and many Democrats have largely supported the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Israel has a right to defend itself. This month, Israel and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza fought an 11-day war that claimed the lives of more than 250 people, mostly in Gaza, according to the United Nations and Israeli officials. The two sides agreed to a cease-fire late last week."
