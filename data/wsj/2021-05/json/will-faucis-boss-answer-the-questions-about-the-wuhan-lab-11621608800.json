    "body": "Did Covid-19 originate in a Chinese laboratory funded in part by a grantee of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases? The world is waiting for an answer, and on Thursday several Republican members of the House and Senate asked Dr. Fauci’s boss to help provide one. A related question is whether the deadly pandemic was the result of “gain-of-function” research, in which scientists genetically engineer deadly viruses which do not exist in nature in order to understand potential future threats.<br />Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Dr. Rand Paul of Kentucky lead the signers of the new letter to Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. The letter contains various footnotes and relies on both government and media reports to assert the following history:<br />The lawmakers then ask a series of questions intended to find out exactly what Americans funded and what exactly happened at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has denied being the source of the pandemic, as has Dr. Shi.<br />The letter also seeks to clarify whether the NIH, in denying responsibility to this point, has adopted a more narrow definition of gain-of-function research than non-government scientists.<br />After a recent inquiry from this column, Dr. Fauci’s public-relations team took its time to craft a statement about the U.S. taxpayer money that ended up at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Fauci institute claims that it never funded gain-of-function research “to be conducted” at the Wuhan Institute of Virology—an interesting phrasing for research conducted in the past. The NIAID also asserted, “It is impossible for us to be aware of nor can we account for all of their activities.”"
