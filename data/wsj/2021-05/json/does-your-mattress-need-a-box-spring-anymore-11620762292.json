    "body": "I HAVE ONE of the world’s tiniest guest bedrooms. This was not a problem during the pandemic. But with the impending return of houseguests—remember them?—I realized recently that I need to transform the 85-square-foot space into a comfortable room.<br />The other day I was standing there, with my arms folded. Actually I was standing in the room’s doorway because there wasn’t really enough room to stand in the room with my arms folded. If I put my arms straight down at my sides, I could stand in the room. But that was uncomfortable for deep thinking. And I was pondering: What would make this sad space more inviting?<br />My gaze naturally settled on the bed itself, which for a full-size double bed seemed huge. Hulking, even. And then—eureka!—I would have slapped my forehead if there were room: The biggest problem was the puffy, princess-and-the-pea box spring and mattress set.<br />“My guest bed really, really dominates the room,” I said to LeeAnn Baker, an interior designer in Seattle whom I phoned for advice. “How do I fix this problem?”<br />“It’s the box spring—a lot of beds don’t have them anymore, and most bed frames these days don’t need them” because they have platforms or slats to support a mattress, Ms. Baker said, adding that the most comfortable height for a bed is from 24 to 26 inches."
