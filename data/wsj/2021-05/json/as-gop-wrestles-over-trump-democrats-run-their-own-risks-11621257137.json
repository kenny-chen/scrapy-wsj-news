    "body": "Republicans are taking quite the risk by tethering their party anew to former President Donald Trump, on whose watch they lost control of the House,  Senate and White House.<br />As often is the case with Mr. Trump, though, the controversy he generates is diverting attention from what’s happening on the other side: Democrats are midway through a considerable risk they also are running.<br />Rarely has a party attempted to turn such a thin electoral mandate into such an expansive agenda. President Biden won the popular vote comfortably in the 2020 election, yet his margins were much smaller in the key electoral states. Meantime, Democrats lost seats in the House and probably squeaked out an even split in the Senate only because Mr. Trump’s postelection controversies helped them win two runoff elections in Georgia. They lost a bit of ground in state legislatures. It wasn’t exactly an across-the-board romp.<br />Yet six months later, Democrats are in the midst of a push to enact a $6 trillion economic stimulus, infrastructure and jobs-creation agenda that would change the relationship between government and the economy, while also pushing progressive ideas on social issues. The risk is that Democrats are overplaying their hand.<br />So how’s the gamble going?"
