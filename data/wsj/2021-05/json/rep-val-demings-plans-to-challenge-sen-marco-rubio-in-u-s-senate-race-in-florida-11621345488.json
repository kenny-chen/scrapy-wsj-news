    "body": "Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who was on President Biden’s shortlist for vice president, plans to challenge Republican Sen. Marco Rubio for a U.S. Senate seat in Florida, according to two people familiar with her plans.<br />Ms. Demings will have a formal announcement in the coming weeks, one of the people said.<br />Ms. Demings, 64 years old, was one of a small group of female lawmakers considered for Mr. Biden’s running mate and was on the team of House Democrats acting as prosecutors in former President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial in 2020. The Orlando congresswoman was a police officer for decades and the first Black woman to lead the Orlando Police Department.<br />Florida was once seen as a key political battleground but it has trended toward Republicans in recent years. Mr. Trump won the state by just over 1 point in 2016 and 3 points in 2020. Mr. Rubio carried the state by 8 points in 2016, after dropping out of the GOP primary for president. Now-NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, lost his Senate seat in 2018.<br />Ms. Demings had been considering running for either the Senate or for Florida governor. Politico first reported her plan to run for the Senate."
