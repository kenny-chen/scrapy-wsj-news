    "body": "A vessel authorities believe was illegally smuggling migrants into the U.S. capsized Sunday off the coast of San Diego with at least 30 people on board, leading to three deaths, authorities said.<br />The accident came as border authorities increase efforts to combat what they say is a surge of migrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally by sea.<br />The first call for help on Sunday came in shortly before 10 a.m. local time from a commercial assistance vessel reporting a boat near the surfline that appeared to be in trouble, authorities said. That boat, described as a 40-foot cabin cruiser, overturned and broke apart near the Cabrillo National Monument, which sits at the southern tip of the Point Loma Peninsula in San Diego.<br />Local and federal authorities responded to a chaotic scene as the passengers scrambled for safety in cold and rough waters. Some people made it to shore, said Rick Romero, a lifeguard lieutenant with the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department.<br />But others were in the water, drowning, getting sucked into the rip current, he said during a press conference."
