    "body": "Just how much inflation would it take for the Federal Reserve to abandon its commitment to super-easy money and begin to talk about tightening? Markets think the answer is that the Fed will accept far more than consumers would like, and the market is probably right: Inflation could easily be at 5% early next year without prompting any change of strategy. So long as the Fed expects inflation to come back down and investors and workers have faith, it is under no pressure to move. The danger is that high inflation shakes that faith.<br />Investors were shocked by the jump in inflation reported last week. The core inflation that economists tend to focus on, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.9% month-on-month in April, an annualized rate above 11%. (Year-over-year, core inflation was 3%.)<br />Bond yields duly jumped, but the 10-year Treasury yield is still below where it stood in March. There is no sign that investors expect the Fed to be anything but super-dovish.<br />“The bar’s going to be really high for the Fed to deviate from the path they’ve laid out,” said Andrew Balls, chief investment officer of global fixed income at Pimco.<br />To see why, consider one fairly rosy scenario for inflation. Over the next six months we have a smooth reduction in monthly core inflation, as supply constraints—shipping, lumber, microchips, cars, worker shortages, everything—ease and consumers have less leftover stimulus to spend. By November, assume prices are rising at a modest 0.17% a month, where they need to be to reach 2% a year. In this scenario the year-over-year rate, the one we usually look at, would peak at 5.2% next February, and still be above 3% next July."
