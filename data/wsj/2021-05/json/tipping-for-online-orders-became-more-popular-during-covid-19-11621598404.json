    "body": "Americans are getting more signals that it is safe to visit bars and restaurants again. The reopening will test whether new tipping norms continue after evolving during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Card-payment data indicate that Americans tipped more during the pandemic. The share of transactions processed by Square Inc. that included a tip increased to 66% on March 1 from 63% a year earlier. The gross amount in payments processed by its sellers was $29.8 billion for the first quarter of this year.<br />The most significant change in gratuities occurred with orders made online or over the phone. For those types of transactions, tipping frequency jumped from just below 50% to nearly 87%, a possible sign that Americans have become more willing to add a gratuity for takeout orders and other services performed remotely.<br />Square, however, said the average tip amount as a percentage of the total tab fell to around 17% from 21% before the pandemic began.<br />“It is possible, but seems unlikely, that the same individuals are both tipping more often and leaving smaller tips now than they did before the pandemic,” said Mike Lynn, a researcher and professor at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration who studies tipping."
