    "body": "Worker filings for jobless benefits likely fell again last week, extending a steady downward trend and adding to signs of a healing labor market as the economy opens more fully.<br />Economists expect the Labor Department to report that initial unemployment claims for regular state programs, a proxy for layoffs, fell last week to 425,000 from 444,000 the prior week. That level would represent the lowest levels of claims since the coronavirus pandemic’s onset last year and the fourth consecutive week claims have reached a fresh pandemic low.<br />Separately, economists forecast that other reports will show that orders for durable goods—items designed to last at least three years—rose 0.9% in April, and that U.S. gross domestic product in the first quarter grew at a 6.6% seasonally adjusted annual rate, higher than the initial 6.4% estimate.<br />Taken together, the data will likely point to an economy that is gaining strength as Covid-19 cases steadily decrease, more Americans receive vaccines against the virus and governments ease restrictions on businesses.<br />“I think there’s still a lot of pain out there, but the good news is that it really looks like the economy is kicking into overdrive, and I do see positive signs for the job market,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings."
