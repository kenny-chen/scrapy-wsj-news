    "body": "Have you heard the one about the Marine with the rolled-up solar panel? It wasn’t exactly Bob Hope and the USO when Kamala Harris attempted humor during a commencement address to graduating sailors and Marines at the Naval Academy last week.<br />Addressing the next generation of America’s warriors, the vice president cracked a quip about how they’d just love all that green investment she and Joe Biden are planning: “Just ask any Marine today, would she rather carry 20 pounds of batteries or a rolled-up solar panel, and I am positive she will tell you a solar panel—and so would he.”<br />Ms. Harris’s attempt at gender-inclusive, environment-friendly comedy elicited an appreciative and raucous peal of laughter—but only from her. The rest of the audience looked like they wanted to crawl under the nearest solar panel.<br />To be fair, It’s not easy to make culturally compliant humor. The best humor is often countercultural, even downright offensive. You can’t be woke and funny.<br />Picture the scene: a roomful of the vice president’s finest young staffers all wielding their critical-theory degrees from Sarah Lawrence and Amherst, brainstorming lines for an unfamiliar audience of brave young fighters."
