    "body": "Covid-19 is spreading rapidly in large developing countries such as Argentina and India, sparking concerns of long-term economic hardship, but prices of their government bonds have barely budged.<br />The disconnect boils down to two factors, analysts and fund managers say. Loose monetary policy and economic reopening in developed countries is fueling global growth. At the same time, some emerging economies can’t afford to shut down. Under those circumstances, investors are willing to hang on to the relatively high-yielding debt, even as cases climb.<br />Bond fund managers remain desperate for government debt that pay attractive returns because yields, which fall when bond prices rise, remain near historic lows in Europe and the U.S. Simultaneously, international demand is booming for the commodities exported by many emerging markets.<br />Indian 10-year bond yields have remained around 6% since infections started to surge compared with the roughly 1.6% paid by the 10-year Treasury note, according to global bond-data provider Cbonds Europe SIA. The Reserve Bank of India bought some bonds to keep the market steady in recent months but international investors also played a part.<br />“Real rates are high in India,” said Polina Kurdyavko, an emerging markets portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management. “All else being equal, it’s attractive.”"
