But as futuristic as Zoom and video streaming are, “distance learning” is nothing new.<br />Thomas Foster launched the International Correspondence Schools in 1890. He was publisher and editor of the Mining Herald newspaper in Shenandoah, Pa. Foster founded the paper after a series of coal-mining accidents and championed safety-training programs and lobbied hard for an 1885 state law requiring miners to pass safety tests.<br />The law was ineffective. Uneducated miners couldn’t pass the tests. To help give them a fighting chance, Foster started publishing test problems in his newspaper. Miners learned at home and mailed back answers to be checked. Seeing a business opportunity, Foster launched ICS, which eventually offered some 250 courses in mechanical engineering, electricity, architecture, plumbing and other trades. Foster was both president and a teacher. By the early 1900s ICS served one million students, more than 1% of the U.S. population at the time.<br />Later William Harper, a former Yale classics professor, became president of the University of Chicago and made correspondence classes a central part of its educational offerings. The university granted degrees in math, biology and the classics mainly through correspondence, though combined with some residential instruction. Between 1924 and 1925 the Correspondence School accounted for 29% of the university’s graduates. By 1926, 143 instructors were teaching 10,545 students, who could complete 50% of a bachelor’s degree and 33% of a master’s through correspondence. Correspondence teaching at Chicago was a victim of its own success: After contentious debates about financing and faculty pay, it spun off into multiple departments and was eventually discontinued.<br />Based on my own experience teaching university students, distance learning ought to work well in languages, math, statistics and perhaps the sciences—areas that focus on objective information—but not in fields requiring debate and discussion, such as history or politics. In the study of human behavior, historical events, models of society and philosophy, it is harder to separate the object of study from those participants debating it."
