    "body": "U.S. airline-passenger numbers are forecast to average as many as two million a day through the Memorial Day holiday, testing the ability of airlines and airports to handle infrequent and, in some cases, unruly fliers.<br />While domestic air-travel numbers last Christmas were only half those in 2019, recent Transportation Security Administration counts have them now hovering around 90% of pre-pandemic levels. The TSA screened 1.9 million passengers last Sunday, a 14-month high.<br />Bookings from leisure travelers heading to the beaches and mountains picked up in March and accelerated in recent weeks, airline executives said at an industry conference this week.<br />“The surge in travel is just now starting to happen,” said Frontier Airlines’ chief executive, Barry Biffle. “Memorial Day is going to be big; the Fourth of July is going to be crazy.”<br />Many holiday-weekend travelers are infrequent fliers, and now some are coming back after more than a year of staying close to home.  American Airlines Group Inc.,  the world’s largest carrier, said a third of its passengers typically take only one trip a year."
