    "body": "For the second time in three years, the Kentucky Derby winner might not be the first horse that crossed the finish line. Now the question is whether Medina Spirit will be allowed to run in Saturday’s Preakness Stakes after a failed drug test put its Kentucky Derby win in peril.<br />Medina Spirit held off Mandaloun by a half-length to win the 147th running of the Kentucky Derby on May 1. But on Sunday, trainer Bob Baffert revealed that Medina Spirit had failed a post-race drug test, which could ultimately lead to the horse’s disqualification. In 2019, Maximum Security was disqualified after veering off course and impeding two rivals during the race.<br />Baffert said Medina Spirit was found to have 21 picograms of betamethasone, which is twice the legal threshold allowed in Kentucky. Betamethasone is a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation and joint pain in horses. Baffert denied wrongdoing and said that “at no point in time, has anyone in my barn or any of my veterinarians” administered betamethasone to Medina Spirit.<br />According to Kentucky regulations, the horse won’t be disqualified until a split sample—collected at the same time as the first sample—confirms the initial test result. The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission didn’t respond to a request for comment on when the split sample results would be available but it isn’t expected until after the Preakness. In a statement,  Churchill Downs  said that if the findings are upheld, Medina Spirit’s win would be invalidated and Mandaloun declared the winner.<br />The situation forces organizers of the Preakness at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore to make a decision on whether to allow Medina Spirit to run before the investigation in Kentucky is fully completed. The post-position draw for the second leg of the Triple Crown was initially set to take place on Monday but was postponed until Tuesday afternoon."
