    "body": "Fox Corp.  said it agreed to acquire Outkick Media, a news outlet focused on sports, politics and culture that was founded by provocateur Clay Travis.<br />While best known for its irreverent takes on sports news, in recent years Outkick Media has featured more content focused on political and social issues, often with a right-leaning viewpoint that is in sync with Fox News opinion programming.<br />Fox Corp. and Outkick Media already have ties. Fox Sports Radio is the home of Mr. Travis’s national daily broadcast. In addition, Mr. Travis is a regular on the Fox Sports 1 cable channel.<br />“Clay and his team have quickly made Outkick a content powerhouse with a very large, loyal and engaged audience. We expect the synergies presented across FOX’s existing portfolio of assets will turbocharge this exciting business,” said Fox Corp. Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Lachlan Murdoch<br />Outkick Media is jointly owned by Mr. Travis and Savage Ventures, which will continue to have a role in operations going forward. Mr. Travis will serve as president of Outkick Media."
