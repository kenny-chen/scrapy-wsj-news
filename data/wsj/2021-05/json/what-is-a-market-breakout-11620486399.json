    "body": "Sometimes Wall Street pros refer to an event known as a “breakout.” For those unfamiliar with the term, here is what it means and why it matters to investors.<br />A breakout refers to a pattern in a price chart where the price of a stock (or other traded asset) breaches a previously unbroken level or a level that hasn’t been breached in a long time, says JC Parets, founder of technical-analysis service AllStarCharts.com. Put simply, the price has “broken out” of a previously defined trading range.<br />The first part of the pattern starts when a stock rallies to a certain level, but then retreats, Mr. Parets says.<br />“What happens is that there is an overwhelming amount of supply at that price level,” he says, meaning investors dump the stock, sending the price lower.<br />A recent example is  ETF (XLF), which tracks a basket of financial stocks. In 2007, before the financial crisis the ETF reached a then-record price of around $31 a share. It traded lower than that for 12 years and didn’t revisit $31 until late 2019. It retreated once again as the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns sent stocks reeling in early 2020. The ETF’s eventual breakout came earlier this year when the price broke through the $31 level. It closed Friday at $37.78."
