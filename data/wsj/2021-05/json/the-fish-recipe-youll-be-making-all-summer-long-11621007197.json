    "body": "“TRADITION IS GREAT, but I don’t think you should be beholden to it,” said chef Rashida Holmes. “It’s fun to play.” In her final Slow Food Fast recipe, spiced and fried whole red snapper, a dish with Caribbean roots, is sauced with a mango chimichurri of the chef’s invention. “I love the way the mango’s acidity works with the spices,” she said.<br />Before cooking the fish, Ms. Holmes rubs on an aromatic paste of garlic, ginger, turmeric and other spices. After a quick fry in a shallow pool of oil, the snapper is crisp on the outside, succulent and flaky within; frying it whole guards against overcooking.<br />Ms. Holmes recommends using a heavy pan for frying and leaving the fish alone until its crust sets. If some seasoning falls off as you flip it, no worries. A good dollop of mango chimichurri will cover up any inconsistencies. Forgiving, visually impressive and full of vibrant flavor, this will make a stunning dish for the return of dinner parties. But it’s also quick and low-pressure enough for any weeknight.<br />WSJ+ Members: Sign up for a seafood cooking class with Rashida Holmes here.<br />—Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of ‘Slow Fires’ (Clarkson Potter)"
