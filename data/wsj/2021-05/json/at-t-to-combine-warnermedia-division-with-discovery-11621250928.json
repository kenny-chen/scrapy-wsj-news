    "body": "AT&T Inc.  and  Discovery Inc.  reached a deal to combine their media assets into a new, publicly traded company, unwinding the telecom company’s big bet on entertainment after less than three years.<br />The new business, which isn’t yet named, will be led by current Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav. The companies said Jason Kilar will retain his title as CEO of AT&T’s WarnerMedia division but declined to say whether he would remain with the newly combined company after it secures regulatory approval.<br />AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey said in an online news conference Monday that he had been “contemplating the structure of our business for some time” and eventually decided that the pairing with Mr. Zaslav’s company would benefit both parties.<br />Mr. Zaslav, a media mogul and longtime friend of WarnerMedia executive and CNN boss Jeff Zucker, said the transaction came together over several months of talks that included chats in the Discovery chief’s Greenwich Village brownstone.<br />Mr. Zaslav said the two media businesses already spend about $20 billion a year to produce new content. WarnerMedia owns cable channels such as HBO, CNN, TNT and TBS as well as the Warner Bros. television and film studio. Discovery has a portfolio that includes its namesake network and HGTV."
