    "body": "MOSCOW—When Alexei Navalny returned to Russia in January after what supporters and Western officials say was an attempt on his life, he knew it was a gamble.<br />Prosecutors had made clear that he would face almost certain imprisonment, potentially sidelining the only opposition leader in years to have rattled Russian President Vladimir Putin.<br />Friends and associates say Mr. Navalny was acutely aware of how other dissidents had largely fallen from view after leaving Russia and he didn’t want to share their fate. Since his return and subsequent detention, his team has instead upped the stakes, releasing charged videos about alleged government corruption and other material online.<br />Mr. Navalny embarked on a hunger strike to demand access to appropriate medical care, a move that some observers believe was also intended to ensure he remains in the public eye after he was sentenced to 2½ years in a prison camp.<br />But as Russian authorities work to shut down what remains of his movement, the coming months could determine the outcome of Mr. Navalny’s standoff with the Kremlin and reveal what, if anything, will succeed him if he fades into obscurity."
