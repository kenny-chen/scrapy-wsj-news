    "body": "Regarding your editorial “A Judicial Blow to Biden’s Tax-Cut Ban” (May 18): As a result of California’s substantial budget surplus, Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to provide middle-class families making up to $75,000 with a $600 rebate. Qualified families with dependents are eligible for an additional $500. Given that the $1.9 trillion Biden spending bill passed in March stipulates that states can’t use their shares of the funds to “directly or indirectly offset a reduction” in “net tax revenue,” doesn’t California have to forfeit its share of federal funds? Surely, if Ohio can’t cut taxes, California should not be allowed to provide rebates. The effect on net tax revenues is the same.<br />Douglas Doty<br />Granite Shoals, Texas"
