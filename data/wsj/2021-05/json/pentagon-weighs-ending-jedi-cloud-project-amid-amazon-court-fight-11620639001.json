    "body": "WASHINGTON—Pentagon officials are considering pulling the plug on the star-crossed JEDI cloud-computing project, which has been mired in litigation from  Amazon.com Inc.  and faces continuing criticism from lawmakers.<br />The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract was awarded to  Microsoft Corp.  in 2019 over Amazon, which has contested the award in court ever since.<br />A federal judge last month refused the Pentagon’s motion to dismiss much of Amazon’s case. A few days later, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said the department would review the project.<br />“We’re going to have to assess where we are with regard to the ongoing litigation around JEDI and determine what the best path forward is for the department,” Ms. Hicks said at an April 30 security conference organized by the nonprofit Aspen Institute.<br />Her comments followed a Pentagon report to Congress, released before the latest court ruling, that said another Amazon win in court could significantly draw out the timeline for the program’s implementation."
