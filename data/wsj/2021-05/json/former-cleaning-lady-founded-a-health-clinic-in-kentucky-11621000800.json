    "body": "Born into a poor eastern Kentucky farming family in 1927, Eula Hall left school after the eighth grade, worked as a domestic cook and cleaner, married an abusive husband and helped him make moonshine. Lacking dental care, she lost all her teeth by age 40.<br />On the plus side, Ms. Hall gained a reputation as a self-taught social worker who fought for decades to bring medical treatment and clean water to her Appalachian neighbors.<br />In 1973, fed up with the failures of a federal program, she decided to take matters into her own hands by founding the nonprofit Mud Creek Clinic in Grethel, Ky. Staffed by idealistic young doctors and nurses, the clinic provided basic care and advice for people who in some cases had never before had professional medical services. Ms. Hall added a food pantry. She drove through the hollers, or valleys, to pick up people who lacked transportation.<br />Ms. Hall died May 8 at her home in Craynor, Ky. She was 93.<br />The clinic became a model for community-health centers serving low-income people. While badgering politicians for more healthcare funding, she made friends with powerful Democrats and Republicans. “She was among the toughest women I’ve ever met,” Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in a tribute."
