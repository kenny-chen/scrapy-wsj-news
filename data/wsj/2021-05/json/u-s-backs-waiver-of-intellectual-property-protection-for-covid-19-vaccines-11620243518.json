    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration said it would back a proposal at the World Trade Organization to waive intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines to help speed up global production.<br />Developing nations led by India and South Africa have been pushing for the waiver, saying it is needed to stem the coronavirus pandemic. More than 100 members of Congress also support the waiver.<br />Pharmaceutical companies and other business groups have opposed the move, saying it wouldn’t solve supply-production problems in the short term because contract producers lack certain necessary technical knowledge.<br />U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the administration based its decision on the pandemic’s extraordinary circumstances.<br />“The administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections but, in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines,” Ms. Tai said."
