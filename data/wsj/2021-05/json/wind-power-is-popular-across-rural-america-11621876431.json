    "body": "Re Robert Bryce’s “Rural America Gets Bad Vibrations from Big Wind” (op-ed, May 6): The reality is that wind projects are driving unmatched investment and creating new opportunities in rural America in ways that improve real lives.<br />Wind projects pay over $1.6 billion in local and state taxes every year—new revenue communities invest in schools, roads and emergency services. They also create new jobs that let young people stay and grow in their communities so they don’t face the awful choice of leaving home to find work to support a family. 120,000 Americans across all 50 states have direct wind jobs.<br />Wind projects also protect the character of agricultural communities. Farmers grow crops and ranchers graze cattle right up to the base of a wind turbine, and a typical wind project leaves 98% of land undisturbed. The lease payments to farmers and ranchers for hosting wind turbines also provide steady income to keep the family farm in the family.<br />Mr. Bryce claims communities are rejecting wind, but communities disagree. That’s why wind has grown exponentially over the past decade. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory surveyed wind-farm neighbors and found 92% of people reported positive or neutral experiences.<br />Heather Zichal"
