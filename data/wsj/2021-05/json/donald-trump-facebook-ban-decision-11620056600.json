    "body": "Facebook Inc.’s  independent oversight board said it would issue a ruling Wednesday morning that could determine whether former President Donald Trump can return to the company’s Facebook and Instagram platforms. Facebook was among social-media platforms that suspended his accounts following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.<br />Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said the suspension was important to reduce the risk of violence through the inauguration of President Biden. The company later referred the suspension to the oversight board as the company grappled with how to treat one of its highest-profile users after his exit from public office.<br />The coming ruling places a spotlight on a relatively new panel that is unique among social-media companies.<br />Facebook has said it found that two posts by the former president violated the company’s rules against praise and support for the riot at the Capitol. In a video posted to Facebook and an accompanying post, Mr. Trump reiterated unsubstantiated claims about election fraud and, while encouraging the rioters to go home peacefully, implied that their actions stemmed from justifiable anger.<br />Facebook ruled that content was prohibited, and Mr. Zuckerberg said Mr. Trump was seeking “to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden.”"
