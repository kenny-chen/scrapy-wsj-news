    "body": "How many times have you walked into a room and had to yell that dinner is ready, only to have your kids stare blankly at you, if they look up from their screens at all? I can’t count the number of times I’ve had to raise my voice when my kids were engrossed in a game or movie they were listening to through headphones.<br />Were they just ignoring me? I doubt it, because this happens even when I announce there’s pizza. It probably means that the volume on their devices was cranked up too loud and I should do something about it before I lose my voice—and my temper.<br />Noise-induced hearing loss is on the rise among young people. Some audiologists say they suspect the problem has only gotten worse during the pandemic, when kids have been glued to their devices for school, entertainment and social connection.<br />An estimated 12.5% of children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 19 have already suffered permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization said last month that more than a billion young adults are at risk of permanent, avoidable hearing loss due to unsafe listening practices, with nearly half of all people ages 12 to 35 in wealthy countries listening to personal audio devices at unsafe sound levels.<br />Fortunately, safeguards are readily available. Noise-canceling and volume-limiting headphones, as well as settings on the devices themselves, are tools parents can use to protect kids’ ears."
