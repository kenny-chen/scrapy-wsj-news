    "body": "India’s laboratories are struggling to keep up with a punishing Covid-19 surge, as its scientists try to track and understand new coronavirus mutations.<br />On Monday, the World Health Organization classified a variant first identified in India, known as B.1.617, as a “variant of concern,” saying preliminary studies suggested it may be more contagious than other variants. The WHO’s scientists didn’t report any evidence that vaccines aren’t effective against the new variant.<br />India is in the process of ramping up its capacity to do genomic sequencing to track changes in the virus’s genetic makeup by examining positive test samples. Yet the effort in India, which is dealing with the world’s worst current Covid-19 outbreak, is a fraction of the scale of the genomic sequencing being done in the U.K.<br />On Tuesday, the Indian government reported 3,876 more deaths over the past 24 hours, taking the toll to nearly 250,000 deaths, with nearly 330,000 new cases added daily. The case count had climbed as high as 400,000 in recent days.<br />Ten laboratories in India are working on the sequencing, with a combined capacity of processing 1,000 samples a day. “The labs have done a fantastic job to rise to the challenge,” said Shahid Jameel, a virologist who is head of the scientific advisory committee for India’s national sequencing effort."
