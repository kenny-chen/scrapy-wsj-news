An increasing number of portfolio managers say they maximize returns with their Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance, or ESG, investment criteria. But is that true, and is it the proper role of financial institutions?<br />A recent analysis by Scientific Beta disputes “claims that ESG funds have tended to outperform the wider market.” Sony Kapoor, managing director of the Nordic Institute for Finance, Technology and Sustainability, a think tank, told the Financial Times that the research “puts in black and white what is only whispered in the corridors of finance—most ESG investing is a ruse to launder reputations, maximize fees and assuage guilt.”<br />BlackRock ’s  former chief investment officer for sustainable investing, Tariq Fancy, appears to understand this. He recently wrote in USA Today that he was concerned about portfolio managers exploiting the “E” of ESG investing because “claiming to be environmentally responsible is profitable” but advancing “real change in the environment simply doesn’t yield the same return.” Mr. Fancy criticized “stalling and greenwashing” in “the name of profits.”<br />This is a tacit admission that ESG investing upends the fiduciary duties portfolio managers owe their clients. As Mr. Fancy acknowledged, “no matter what they tout as green investing, portfolio managers are legally bound” to “do nothing that compromises profits.” As former Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia wrote on these pages last year, under the federal law that protects retirement assets, known as Erisa, “one ‘social’ goal trumps all others—retirement security for American workers.”<br />No one should be surprised when portfolio managers pay lip service to ESG investment criteria while in practice looking for companies that will generate higher profits. To the extent portfolio managers use ESG to justify investing in companies that are less profitable than alternatives, they are imposing a tax on their clients in the form of reduced returns. But shareholders don’t agree to pay this tax, and most have no idea the extent to which it’s being imposed."
