    "body": "U.S. stock futures rose, putting indexes on course for further gains as investors awaited fresh data on the health of the housing market.<br />Futures tied to the broad S&P 500 index rose 0.3%, while blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 0.2%. Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.7%, putting technology stocks on course to rise after the opening bell, a day after they led broader markets higher.<br />Stocks jumped to start the week, as recent comments from Federal Reserve officials helped ease concerns that rising inflation could stamp out growth or prompt the central bank to suddenly tighten policy.<br />“The comments we have had from Fed speakers have told the market exactly what it wants to hear: that they are not concerned about the inflation data and that it hasn’t changed their plan to be very cautious,” said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.<br />Bitcoin prices steadied following several days of whipsaw trading for cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin edged down less than 0.1% to $38,812 from late Monday afternoon. Investors felt reassured during the recent episode that more traditional asset classes haven’t been harmed by Bitcoin’s volatile trading, said Mr. Gimber."
