    "body": "Google  Photos had me from the start with a killer feature: free, unlimited photo and video backup. The caveat? It compressed image files larger than 16 megapixels.<br />I knew, when the service launched in 2015, that the perk couldn’t last forever. Millions of people dumping all their snapshots into the cloud? It wasn’t sustainable, even for Google.<br />Next month, Google Photos is ending its free tier. After June 1, any newly uploaded media will count toward the 15 gigabytes included with any Google account—unless you currently own a Pixel phone. That means your photos compete with your Gmail and anything in your Google Drive. If you have had the account a while, you might already be close to full. Many people will need to upgrade to a paid plan or back up their photos elsewhere.<br />The change gives us freeloaders the opportunity to rethink the future of our digital memories. Here’s one option for archiving your photos offline, plus a look at different online backup options.<br />While online services are the easiest way to back up and access your photos, we first need to discuss a way to store photos yourself. If you don’t choose to use an online option, you would still have this, and even if you do, it’s nice to have an offline backup. Your memories are too precious!"
