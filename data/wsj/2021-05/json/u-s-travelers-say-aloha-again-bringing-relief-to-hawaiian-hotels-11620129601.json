    "body": "HONOLULU—Hawaii’s hospitality industry is slowly returning to life, belatedly joining the mainland’s rebound as the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and fewer travel restrictions are helping to fill the state’s restaurants and hotel beds.<br />Waikiki Beach is crowded with surfers. Farther north, families with toddlers are playing on the shoreline at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. Long lines form outside nearby restaurants and shaved-ice stores.<br />Occupancy rates in Hawaii’s hotels reached 49% for the week ended April 24, according to hotel data tracker STR.<br />That is still below the 57% occupancy level nationwide, STR said. Hawaii has experienced a slower recovery than many other destinations on the U.S. mainland. One big reason is that travelers from Japan, a crucial source of the state’s tourism, and other foreign visitors haven’t much returned.<br />But even nearly half of Hawaii’s hotel rooms filled at the end of April is a notable uptick from a year earlier, when the state had only a 12% occupancy rate."
