    "body": "Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit failed a postrace drug test, trainer Bob Baffert said on Sunday, raising the prospect of a disqualification in horse racing’s marquee event.<br />Baffert said he was told of the positive result by Kentucky officials on Saturday. He said he didn’t know how Medina Spirit could have tested positive and denied any wrongdoing.<br />Medina Spirit, who pulled off a Derby upset at odds of 12-1 on May 1, tested positive for betamethasone, an anti-inflammatory drug that could ultimately lead to the horse’s disqualification.<br />“It is our understanding that Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit’s postrace blood sample indicated a violation of the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s equine medication protocols. The connections of Medina Spirit have the right to request a test of a split sample and we understand they intend to do so. To be clear, if the findings are upheld, Medina Spirit’s results in the Kentucky Derby will be invalidated and Mandaloun will be declared the winner,”  Churchill Downs  said in a statement.<br />According to Kentucky regulations, the horse won’t be disqualified until a split sample confirms the result. The winner’s share of $1.86 million would be forfeited. Bettors who wagered on the horse in the Derby, however, wouldn’t have to return their winnings."
