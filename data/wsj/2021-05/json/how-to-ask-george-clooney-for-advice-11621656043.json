    "body": "In Personal Board of Directors, top business leaders talk about the people they turn to for advice, and how those people have shaped their perspective and helped them succeed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />Bryan Lourd is more used to doling out advice than to seeking it.<br />“I’m trained to be the person helping,” said Mr. Lourd.<br />As a co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency, Hollywood’s most prestigious talent-representation firm, Mr. Lourd helps shepherd the careers of Brad Pitt, Scarlett Johansson, Lady Gaga, Lorne Michaels and many more actors, writers and directors. As one of the agency’s leaders, he oversees a staff of nearly 2,000 that does the same. It’s a job that comes with several traditions (a start in the mailroom, for one) and a credo: Everything is about the client. Their desires, their needs, their hopes and dreams—a cocktail of demands that requires some hard-won emotional intelligence.<br />“All of the dysfunction in my life made me great at this job,” he jokes. “I don’t know anyone who came from a supernormal home or town who’s great at this job.”"
