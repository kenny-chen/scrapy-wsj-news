    "body": "Alphabet Inc.’s  Google announced a series of moves to offer employees more workplace flexibility, allowing a fifth of its staff to work from home permanently and another fifth of workers to shift to a different geographic location.<br />In an email on Wednesday, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said the company envisions that about 20% of staff would work from home on a permanent basis, while another 20% of staff would shift to new offices. The remaining 60% of staff will work from their current location. Employees will have to apply for both location-change options, with approval being up to their managers.<br />Google is also moving to a hybrid workweek, where employees work from offices about three days a week, and two days “wherever they work best,” Mr. Pichai said in the email.<br />The company also will offer four weeks per year where staff can work from anywhere with manager approval, a move that aims to give employees more flexibility around summer and holiday travel.<br />“The future of work is flexibility,” Mr. Pichai said. He said the changes aimed to help staff do their best work."
