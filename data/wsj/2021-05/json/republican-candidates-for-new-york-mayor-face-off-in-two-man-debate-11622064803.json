    "body": "The two Republican candidates for New York City mayor faced off in their first televised debate Wednesday, sparring over political ideologies, qualifications and former President Donald Trump.<br />Fernando Mateo, an entrepreneur and activist, and Curtis Sliwa, a radio host and founder of the street-safety group Guardian Angels, are both campaigning for a change in leadership after two-terms of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.<br />They called for full support of the city’s police department, with Mr. Sliwa demanding “refund the police” and Mr. Mateo taking the position that there should be thousands more police officers.<br />With only a few weeks left until the June 22 primary, they discussed their plans for economic recovery, and how they can convince the city’s millions of Democrats to vote for them in the general election.<br />Registered Republicans in the city are outnumbered by Democrats by more than six to one, although there have been two mayors over the last 30 years who ran as Republicans."
