    "body": "After more than 120 years, baseball’s all-time mark for no-hitters in a season is in serious danger of falling. There have been six already in 2021—and it’s only late May. At this rate, baseball will match the record of eight by the All-Star break, reaching a number last seen in the prehistoric baseball days of 1884.<br />And at least batters in 1884 could be forgiven for whiffing: that was the first season pitchers were allowed to throw the ball overhand.<br />Hitters in 2021 can’t claim novelty as an excuse. They can blame the speed of the fastballs whizzing by them. Or perhaps it’s their home-run focused approach that’s failing. Maybe it’s because of the shift or sticky substances purportedly on some pitchers’ fingers<br />But the numbers are clear: hitting is going through a steep depression in 2021.<br />The season isn’t yet two months old, but even a small fraction of a Major League Baseball season produces a remarkable amount of information. There have already been more than 50,000 plate appearances and more than 200,000 pitches. It’s such a rich dataset that statistical oddities have been erased by sheer volume."
