    "body": "Government bond yields in the U.S. and Europe are ending the week on a downward note with investors seeking safety after a volatile few days in stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies.<br />The outlook for interest rates has been muddied by strong recent inflation data, which supports higher rates, coming up against negative surprises in economic activity, which augurs lower ones. That has cast uncertainty among investors ahead of interest-rate meetings for the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank in June.<br />Economic forecasters have been caught off guard by recent data releases, suggesting they have been too optimistic about the U.S. reopening proceeding smoothly. Citigroup’s U.S. economic surprise index, which measures whether such data beats or misses expectations, is on the verge of turning negative for the first time in almost a year.<br />U.S. 10-year Treasury yields slipped Friday and are lower on the week at 1.625%, down from 1.635% at the end of last week, according to Tradeweb. Yields on 10-year German government bonds touched minus 0.139% Friday, before rebounding slightly to minus 0.130%, which is down from last Friday’s close of minus 0.122%.<br />European yields had risen sharply earlier this month, with Germany now the only economy in the eurozone to have negative-yielding 10-year bonds."
