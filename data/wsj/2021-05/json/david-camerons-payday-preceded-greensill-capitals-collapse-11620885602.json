    "body": "Former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron was looking for his next act after leaving office in the shadow of the Brexit vote in 2016. He found it in Greensill Capital.<br />He jetted around the world on the specialty finance firm’s private aircraft, lobbying corporate executives and government officials. He earned an annual salary, bonus and cashed out stock options in 2019, bringing him several millions of dollars in total, said people familiar with his compensation.<br />And then it all fell apart. The company collapsed into bankruptcy in March, stranding $10 billion in investor funds. It is under investigation in the U.K. and Germany. The U.K. government last month announced a review into contracts it gave to Greensill and Mr. Cameron’s lobbying for access to taxpayer funds.<br />Mr. Cameron, who has denied doing anything improper, is set to testify before a U.K. parliament committee on Thursday, a rare instance of a former prime minister being hauled before parliament.<br />“Much of the reporting around David Cameron’s association with Greensill Capital has not been accurate,” said a spokesman for Mr. Cameron. He declined to comment further, adding that Mr. Cameron will answer questions at the hearing."
