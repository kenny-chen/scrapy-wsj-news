    "body": "WASHINGTON—When violence breaks out in international hot spots, the typical U.S. response has been an immediate, forceful call for a cease-fire, and a demand that the combatants settle differences through negotiations.<br />When it came to the current flare up between Israelis and Palestinians, President Biden took more than a week to make such a call.<br />Even then, the White House was more cautious than in the past. The president only went so far as to say he “supported” a cease-fire, a statement that the administration’s critics saw as weak, especially since it was paired with caveats about Israel’s right to defend its citizens.<br />The careful language reflects Mr. Biden’s delicate balancing act between seeking a productive relationship with the Israeli government—long a priority with many politicians of the president’s generation—and appeasing a more restive element of his Democratic Party. Even its more centrist members are now echoing some of the impatience with Israel of the party’s progressive wing.<br />Republican lawmakers who have spoken out, meanwhile, mostly have urged strong support for Israel. Sen. Todd Young (R., Ind.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) called for efforts to achieve a cease-fire quickly over the weekend."
