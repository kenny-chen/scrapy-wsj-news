    "body": "Facebook  and Instagram will begin allowing users to hide “like” counts on their posts, even after pilot tests of the feature didn’t show meaningful impact on how people use the platforms or feel about themselves.<br />The “like” button, which first appeared on Facebook in 2009 in the form of a thumbs-up symbol, has for years been the primary measure of social-media success.<br />Facebook Inc., which owns Instagram, two years ago began experimenting with hiding likes in the hope that it might be good for users’ mental health and reduce anxiety about the popularity of their posts, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said.<br />He said the company was willing to make the change even if it proved detrimental to its business interests.<br />“The hope here was to try and depressurize the experience a little bit,” Mr. Mosseri said on a call with reporters ahead of the feature’s formal rollout. “It turned out that it didn’t actually change nearly as much about the experience in terms of how people felt or how much they use the experience as we thought it would.”"
