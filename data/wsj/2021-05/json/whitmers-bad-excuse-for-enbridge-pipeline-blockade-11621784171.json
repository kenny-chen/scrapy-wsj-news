    "body": "I suppose “Pipeline Politics Threatens Energy Up North” (op-ed, May 18) by David Jacobson and Gary Doer had to be diplomatic, but the shutdown of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline is hiding behind “environmental concerns” expressed by Michigan’s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The Great Lakes environment is an excuse to help meet the goal of transitioning, ASAP, from fossil fuels to a nation powered entirely by renewable sources of electricity, regardless of the cost to the taxpayers or our good neighbor and longtime ally, Canada. The game plan is simply delay, deny or revoke permits associated with fossil-fuel projects for any reason, and environmental excuses are the easiest to drum up.<br />Fewer producing wells coupled with higher transportation and refining costs will make renewables seem more palatable, and federal as well as state subsidies of renewables will further advance the goal.<br />Lawrence L.
