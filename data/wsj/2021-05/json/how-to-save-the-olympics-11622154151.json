    "body": "The Tokyo Olympics will begin July 23—unless they’re canceled or delayed again over Covid-19. That’s Japan’s decision, but the U.S. can do more to help its ally.<br />A Monday State Department travel advisory, citing Covid-19 cases in Japan, urged Americans to avoid travel to the country. This won’t have much practical effect, but it sends the wrong message as Japan begins to welcome tens of thousands of athletes and officials to the country ahead of the Olympics.<br />Tokyo and several other Japanese prefectures are in a state of emergency, and some hospitals are under serious strain. Yet the country of 125 million has suffered fewer than 13,000 Covid-19 deaths. Over the previous week Japan reported a daily average of 109 deaths and nearly 5,000 new cases.<br />Japan has fared well compared with the U.S. and Europe during the pandemic, but it has fallen behind on vaccination. That’s dangerous in Japan, where more than 29% of the country is age 65 or older. Only 5.2% had received at least one vaccine dose, with 2.3% fully vaccinated as of May 24.<br />Many Japanese fear that opening up now will lead to the import of more Covid-19 variants. Some 83% of Japanese want to cancel or delay the Olympics, an Asahi newspaper survey found this month. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, whose approval rating has sunk to barely above 30%, has vowed to hold the Olympics—and to vaccinate the country’s elderly population by the end of July."
