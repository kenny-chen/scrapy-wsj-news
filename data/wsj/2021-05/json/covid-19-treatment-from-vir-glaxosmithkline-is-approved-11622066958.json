    "body": "A monoclonal antibody drug to treat early Covid-19 infections has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said  Vir Biotechnology Inc.  and  GlaxoSmithKline PLC ,  makers of the drug.<br />The drug, called sotrovimab, is the third antibody medicine authorized to treat patients early in the course of disease who are at high risk of developing severe cases.<br />Vir and Glaxo said in March that a study of the drug had been stopped early because it was shown to be highly effective, reducing hospitalizations or death by 85%, compared with a placebo.<br />The authorization of a new Covid-19 drug at a time when half of the U.S. population has received at least one vaccine dose is a reminder of the massive investments made by governments and drug makers last year that may take years to pay off, if ever.<br />Vir and Glaxo are betting that the globe will be fighting Covid-19 for years to come, even if at a much-reduced scale, because of new virus variants and uneven vaccination rates."
