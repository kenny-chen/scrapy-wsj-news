    "body": "SEOUL—South Korea has a wealthy-country solution to alleviate its delayed rollout of Covid-19 vaccines: propose a swap with  the U.S., which has one of the world’s biggest supplies.<br />With its president visiting the White House on Friday, South Korea is expected to suggest an exchange of millions of doses on a one-for-one basis: The U.S. provides vaccinations now from its growing pile of unused shots. South Korea—with less than 3% of the population fully vaccinated—will send its supply to the U.S. in the months ahead.<br />South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in Washington for a four-day visit that ends Saturday, will have semiconductors and North Korea on the agenda for his summit with President Biden.<br />The priority Mr. Moon is putting on the Covid-19 vaccine highlights how even wealthy countries with rollout blueprints find themselves confounded by a global supply backlog—and look at the U.S.’s massive pile as a potential solution.<br />Nearly 90% of the world’s Covid-19 vaccines to date have been administered in wealthy countries, according to the International Rescue Committee, a nonprofit organization that works on humanitarian crises. Production setbacks in India and by  Pfizer Inc.  in Europe have slowed critical distribution plans to poorer countries."
