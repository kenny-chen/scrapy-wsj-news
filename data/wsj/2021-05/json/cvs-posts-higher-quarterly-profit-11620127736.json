    "body": "CVS Health Corp.  said demand for Covid-19 vaccinations has fallen by about 30% recently as Americans’ hesitancy to receive the shots outweighs expanding eligibility and access.<br />The pharmacy chain has administered more than 17 million shots, which are now available at more than 8,300 U.S. locations. Like rivals, CVS has begun offering same-day appointments for injections in a bid to improve uptake.<br />In the early months of the U.S. vaccine rollout, restrictions on who could receive a vaccine and short supply of doses prevented many people from getting shots. Now, many parts of the country are reporting excess doses and unfilled appointments even as less than 60% of American adults have received at least one dose.<br />Anyone 16 or older is eligible for a vaccine in the U.S., a change from the months in which only certain groups of people could get a shot.<br />Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  last month asked U.S. health regulators to allow their Covid-19 vaccine to be given to adolescents to extend their shot’s use to children 12 years and older."
