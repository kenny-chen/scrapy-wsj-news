    "body": "LONDON—Edward Bramson’s Sherborne Investors said it sold its entire stake in  Barclays  PLC, giving up on a yearslong activist campaign to restructure the bank.<br />Sherborne, which seeks to influence the strategy of companies it owns shares in, was one of the bank’s biggest shareholders with a 6% stake before the sale. Mr. Bramson unsuccessfully attempted to join the board of Barclays and petitioned its chief executive, American banker Jes Staley, to scale back investment-banking operations in favor of investing more in its U.K. retail bank.<br />Sherborne began amassing shares in Barclays in 2018, when the lender’s shares traded around £2. Sherborne said it sold its Barclays shares at an average price of £1.86. The bank’s shares rose more than 1% to £1.80 in early trading in London on Friday. They have gained 70% in the past 12 months, following a swoon during the pandemic selloff a year ago.<br />“It is a pity that the opportunity did not arise to join the board of Barclays to assist in a turnaround,” Sherborne said in a statement.<br />A Barclays spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
