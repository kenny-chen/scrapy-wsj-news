    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. blocked a proposed statement being considered by United Nations Security Council members on Monday that would have condemned the violence in Gaza and called for a cease-fire between warring parties, diplomats said.<br />China drafted the statement late on Sunday following an emergency session of the Security Council held virtually to discuss the crisis. Security Council members were required to voice any opposition by noon Monday. The U.S. opposition to the statement prevented it from being released, the diplomats said. No vote was held.<br />The dispute over the proposed statement was the latest instance of the U.S. and China publicly clashing at the U.N. over a foreign policy matter. The U.S. and China sparred at the Security Council as recently as last week over China’s treatment of its Uyghur minority.<br />China, which holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council for the month of May, accused the U.S. of preventing the U.N. Security Council from speaking about the international crisis in one voice.<br />“We urge the U.S. to shoulder its fair share of responsibilities, take a just stance, and work with the majority of the international community to support the Security Council,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters on Monday."
