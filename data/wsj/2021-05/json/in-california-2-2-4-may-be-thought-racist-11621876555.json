    "body": "In “California Leftists Try to Cancel Math Class” (op-ed, May 19), Williamson M. Evers correctly quotes some of the antiracist dogmas being promoted that will frustrate math learning. However, many of the improvements recommended for classroom instruction (i.e., teaching math in the context of practical problem solving for life, paying attention to students’ learning modes, using common sense about prerequisites, etc.) have been known for decades and been used and promoted by teachers who are skilled in math education. The best teachers already use those techniques and are successful with them, independent of what color their students’ skin is.<br />The known, good curriculum improvements have nothing to do with racism; associating them with racism isn’t going to help students with math so much as pit students against each other in yet another domain of human productivity.<br />Andrew Griffis<br />Tucson, Ariz.<br />"
