    "body": "Regarding William McGurn’s “Who’s Afraid of Tim Scott?” (Main Street, May 4): Sen. Tim Scott’s being called “Uncle Tim,” evoking “Uncle Tom,” in reaction to his rebuttal to President Biden’s address to Congress, made me question the epithet’s derivation. I had just read Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” and couldn’t reconcile the term, implying craven submissiveness, with the character I met in the novel.<br />As a slave, Tom complies with his master’s commands except where they conflict with his conscience. In two instances, he draws the line. He refuses to whip a slave woman. And he dies at the hands of his master for refusing to tell where two slave women are hiding, attempting to escape.<br />Why, I wondered, did the name of Stowe’s hero become pejorative?<br />I googled “Uncle Tom” and learned its connotation emanated from minstrel-show retellings of Stowe’s classic in the years that followed its 1852 release. In other words, her Tom was redefined by actors comfortable with prevailing racist norms.<br />My response to the vitriolic reaction to Mr. Scott’s speech is: Just a minute. You condemn racism on the one hand but on the other, rankled by a self-assured senator’s being a black Republican, you use an epithet attributed to minstrel-show retellings performed by pro-slavery men in black face. Where is your moral authority to decry racism?"
