    "body": "General Motors Co.  said Thursday it is restarting production at a handful of factories that were previously idled because of a global shortage of semiconductors.<br />The Detroit-based auto maker plans to resume some production at a factory in Michigan next month, after halting work at the facility in early May. It also plans to restart several auto factories in Canada, Mexico and South Korea within the next several weeks that make models such as the Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain crossover vehicles.<br />Despite the reopening of these facilities, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has said the company expects the second quarter to be the auto makerâ€™s weakest of 2021 in terms of reduced production before some recovery occurs in the back half of the year.<br />The computer-chip shortage continues to cloud an otherwise robust new-vehicle market, more than a year after the Covid-19 health crisis led to a collapse in U.S. auto sales and production last spring.<br />The lack of semiconductors, used in engines, braking systems and other vehicle components, has led to factory disruptions across the auto industry and left dealers with nearly bare new-car lots. It is also prompting companies to reduce their manufacturing and earnings forecasts for the year."
