    "body": "WASHINGTON—The nation’s first large-scale offshore wind farm has received its final federal approval, foreshadowing a potential new energy industry on the Atlantic Coast after more than a decade of false starts.<br />Vineyard Wind, a $2.8 billion project off the coast of Massachusetts, is likely to start construction within a year and operation in 2023, project leaders said. The Biden administration said Tuesday it had approved the project’s construction and operations plans for as many as 84 turbines 12 miles off Nantucket, saying it could be a major job creator and address climate change.<br />In a written statement, Vineyard Wind Chief Executive Lars Pedersen said federal approval “is not about the start of a single project, but the launch of a new industry.”<br />The project is planned to generate as many as 800 megawatts for Massachusetts ratepayers, enough to power 400,000 homes and businesses, the company and the Interior Department said. U.S. approval was needed because the project is in federal waters.<br />Vineyard Wind was just the first of roughly 10 offshore projects waiting for permit reviews at the Interior Department as investors seek to meet growing demand for zero-emissions energy."
