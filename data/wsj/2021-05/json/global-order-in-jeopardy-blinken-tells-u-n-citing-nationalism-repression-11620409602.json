    "body": "WASHINGTON—U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the United Nations Security Council on Friday that the international order was in “serious jeopardy” in comments that decried what he described as rising nationalism and repression around the world.<br />In a veiled critique of Russia’s incursions into Ukraine and China’s treatment of its Muslim Uyghur population and roll back of freedoms in Hong Kong, Mr. Blinken criticized other countries for flouting international agreements on borders and respect for human rights.<br />“When U.N. member states, particularly members of the Security Council, flout these rules and block attempts to hold accountable those who violate international law, it sends the message that others can break those rules with impunity,” Mr. Blinken said, without specifically naming Russia or China. “All of us must accept scrutiny.”<br />Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who chaired the virtual meeting on multilateralism, responded, “I’m sure all countries would be glad to see the United States change course and make a real contribution to practicing multilateralism.”<br />Russia openly called out the U.S. and Europe for a list of grievances, accusing the West of adopting a posture of exceptionalism and singling out President Biden’s planned Summit for Democracy, to take place during his first year in office."
