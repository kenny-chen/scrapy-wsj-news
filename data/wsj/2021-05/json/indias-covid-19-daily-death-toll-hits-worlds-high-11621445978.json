    "body": "DEHRADUN, India—India recorded the world’s highest number of deaths from Covid-19 in a single day, as the country suffers through one of the most ferocious surges of the pandemic.<br />On Wednesday, India reported 4,529 deaths in the past 24 hours, topping the previous high set by the U.S. on Jan. 12, when it recorded 4,475 deaths. It was the ninth time this month that India has recorded more than 4,000 deaths in a single day.<br />The rising death toll comes following a surge in cases that rose faster than any the world had previously seen, overwhelming the country’s healthcare system, with hospitals turning patients away and running short of beds, oxygen and Covid-19 medications.<br />Crematoriums too were running short of space and wood. At one of the largest cremation grounds in New Delhi, the Nigam Bodh Ghat, its 120 wooden platforms where bodies are cremated weren’t enough. It had to add 32 more, said Vishal Mishra, who helps run the crematorium.<br />On the banks of the Ganges River in the city of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous state, the Bhairav Ghat cremation ground has received more than 1,000 people who died of Covid-19 since mid-April, said Dhaniram Panther, a 55-year-old social worker helping to cremate bodies."
