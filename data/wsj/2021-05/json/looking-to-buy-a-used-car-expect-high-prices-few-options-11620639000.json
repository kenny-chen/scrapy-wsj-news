    "body": "A monthslong rise in used-car sales has left bargain-hunters with increasingly limited options on lots across the U.S.<br />The average price paid for a preowned vehicle hit a record of $25,463 in April, about $2,800 higher than in the same month last year, according to research firm J.D. Power. It also was the first time ever that the average used-car price had exceeded $25,000, the firm said.<br />The climb, which began last year, has surprised some dealers who say they don’t see the trend ending soon.<br />“What is normally a depreciable asset has been appreciating,” said Phil Maguire, who owns Maguire Family Dealerships, a group of 13 stores in New York state. “It’s certainly surreal, and I guess we can all agree that it’s an anomaly.” Dealers say they are having to pay more to keep their lots stocked.<br />The surge is being driven in part by the global chip shortage, which is straining inventories on the new-car side and leading more consumers to shop the preowned market. At the same time, used-car supplies were tight heading into the year because people were hanging on to their leased vehicles longer, according to analysts, executives and dealers. Rental-car companies also had pared back their fleets early in the pandemic, leaving them with fewer vehicles to sell later in the year."
