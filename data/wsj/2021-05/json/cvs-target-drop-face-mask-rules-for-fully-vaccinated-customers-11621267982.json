The company said it would obey local ordinances requiring face coverings, and that it would continue increased safety and cleaning measures, including social distancing, in its stores.<br />Walmart Inc.  and  Costco Wholesale Corp.  said last week they would drop mask requirements for vaccinated shoppers.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that fully vaccinated people didn’t need to wear a mask or physically distance during outdoor or indoor activities, large or small, in most settings."
