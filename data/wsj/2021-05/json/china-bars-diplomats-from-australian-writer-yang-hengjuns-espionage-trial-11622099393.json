    "body": "Chinese authorities denied Australian diplomats access to the trial of an Australian writer accused of espionage in a case that has exacerbated tensions between the two nations.<br />The trial of Yang Hengjun, an Australian blogger and spy novelist, was scheduled to begin behind closed doors at the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court on Thursday. Speaking outside the courthouse, Australia’s ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher, said Australian diplomats were told they couldn’t enter the court because of the coronavirus pandemic. But he said China’s Foreign Ministry told the Australians that access was denied because it is a national-security case.<br />“This is deeply regrettable and concerning and unsatisfactory,” Mr. Fletcher said. “We’ve had longstanding concerns about this case, including lack of transparency and, therefore, have concluded that it is an instance of arbitrary detention.”<br />A Chinese Embassy spokesperson in Australia said last week that Australia should respect China’s sovereignty and refrain from interfering in Mr. Yang’s case.<br />“Chinese judicial authorities handle the case strictly in accordance with law and fully protect the lawful rights of the relevant person,” the spokesperson said."
