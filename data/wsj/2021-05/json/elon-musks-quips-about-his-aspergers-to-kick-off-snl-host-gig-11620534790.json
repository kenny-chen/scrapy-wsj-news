    "body": "Elon Muskkicked off his “Saturday Night Live” hosting debut finding a new target to mock: himself.<br />Mr. Musk, known for his awkwardness at times, also said he was the first person with Asperger’s syndrome to host the show—“or at least the first to admit it.” It’s the first time he has publicly said he has the condition.<br />The chief executive of  Tesla Inc.  and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX—and who is known for sometimes taking swipes at rivals on Twitter—issued a faux apology as part of the host’s customary opening monologue.<br />“To anyone I’ve offended, I just want to say, I reinvented electric cars, and I’m sending people to Mars in a rocket ship,” Mr. Musk said. “Did you think I was also going to be a chill, normal dude?”<br />The early cracks stopped short of some of Mr. Musk’s edgier comments. In the past, he has taken swipes at the Securities and Exchange Commission and billionaireJeff Bezos."
