    "body": "James Rosen’s review of Serhii Plokhy’s “Nuclear Folly” (Bookshelf, April 20) opens with the statement that the Cuban missile crisis was something for “which [Nikita] Khrushchev himself was responsible.” This is not true. The placing of the Russian missiles in Cuba was a direct response to President Kennedy’s placement of missiles in Turkey. When the U.S. objected to the Cuban missiles, Khrushchev offered to withdraw them if the U.S. withdrew the missiles in Turkey. President Kennedy refused and escalated the confrontation. The confrontation was resolved when he agreed to withdraw the missiles in Turkey, provided this was kept secret from the public, and Russia agreed publicly to withdraw the missiles from Cuba.<br />Leslie Trager<br />Falmouth, Mass."
