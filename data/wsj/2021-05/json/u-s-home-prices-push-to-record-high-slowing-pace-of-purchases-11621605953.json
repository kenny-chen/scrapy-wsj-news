    "body": "America’s home-buying frenzy is cooling off for the first time since it heated  up last year, as limited inventory and record high prices are excluding potential buyers.<br />Existing-home sales fell 2.7% in April from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.85 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. April marked the third straight monthly decline, the longest downward stretch since last spring, when Covid-19-related lockdowns eased and have boomed in the past year.<br />The forces driving home sales haven’t gone away. Low mortgage rates and the rise of remote work, which sent buyers scrambling to find larger living spaces, are still spurring demand.<br />This year started off strong, after 2020 experienced the fastest pace of home sales in 14 years.<br />But a deficit of homes for sale relative to intense demand and vertiginous housing prices have started easing the pace of sales. The median existing-home price rose to $341,600 in April, the highest on record, NAR said. The annual price appreciation of more than 19% was the strongest in data going back to 1999."
