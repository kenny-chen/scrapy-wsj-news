    "body": "Barack and Michelle Obama said Saturday that Bo, a Portuguese water dog that lived with the family over two White House terms, died after battling cancer.<br />The dog fulfilled a 2008 campaign promise the Obamas made to their daughters, Malia and Sasha, that the family would get a puppy after the election.<br />The former president called Bo a true friend and loyal companion in a message on his Twitter account Saturday. He recalled how Bo loved to jump in the pool in the summer, was unflappable with children and lived for scraps around the dinner table.<br />“He was exactly what we needed and more than we ever expected,” Mr. Obama said in a tweet. “We will miss him dearly.”<br />Bo was a 2009 gift from Edward Kennedy, the late Democratic senator from Massachusetts. He was born in Texas and spent a month in his first owner’s home in Washington, D.C., before living with Mr. Kennedy’s trainer in Virginia for a month. He went on to fly on Air Force One and was there when Pope Francis visited the White House."
