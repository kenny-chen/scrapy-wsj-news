    "body": "The first time that Stephen Curry and LeBron James met in the NBA Finals, one of the fans in the Golden State Warriors’ crowd was a recent college graduate named Juan Toscano-Anderson. He watched the rest of the series on television, like anyone who grew up rooting for the Warriors, and he was at home in the Bay Area when they won the championship.<br />The NBA draft was held a few days later. If teams knew then what they know now, he might have been a first-round pick. But he wasn’t disappointed when he went undrafted. As it turns out, he wasn’t even watching.<br />Toscano-Anderson knew there was no way that he was going to play in the NBA.<br />Some players are undervalued. He was simply unvalued. But that night in 2015 began a series of preposterous developments that would take Juan Toscano-Anderson from his mother’s home in Oakland after college to Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, an open tryout for the G League, a spot at the end of the Warriors’ bench and now, incredibly, a game featuring the sport’s biggest stars.<br />He’s gone from being in the arena with Steph and LeBron to being on the court with them."
