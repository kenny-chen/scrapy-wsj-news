    "body": "‘If I were permitted one phone call,” my 18-year old daughter, Molly, recently told me, “and my life depended on that person picking up, I’d call you.” How nice, I thought, but she wasn’t finished: “Not mom.” Ouch.<br />Sure, I tend to pick up more often than Devin, my wife, does, especially when it’s family calling. But unlike my daughter, I don’t assume I’m being screened whenever my call goes directly to voice mail. In fact, I don’t mind at all.<br />I can’t blame Molly, or any other digital native who grew up with the instant-gratification expectations that smartphones engender. These cherubic callers simply have never experienced frontier justice as administered by the busy signal.<br />For them, the options have always been a successful conversation or a shot at voice mail. By contrast, most peak-hour calls made in my 1980s adolescence resulted in the dreaded busy signal, telephony’s equivalent of being told “Ask Again Later” by the then-popular Magic 8-Ball.<br />The busy signal wouldn’t have put you through to voice mail even if the technology had existed. The busy signal didn’t care if you were the queen of England. The busy signal told you someone had beaten you to the punch, plain and simple. The busy signal was bigger than you."
