    "body": "The prices of cryptocurrencies like dogecoin have posted incredible gains in recent weeks, leaving some on the sidelines to wonder: Is it too late to buy?<br />Some early buyers are holding on tight and encouraging newcomers, but others say it might be time to look at other cryptocurrencies or skip them altogether.<br />“In many ways it’s encouraging to see more people dipping their toes into trading, but this is more like betting on a horse than investing,” said Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown PLC, about dogecoin. “It’s very difficult if not impossible to determine when demand will subside.”<br />Interest has been gaining steam, with dogecoin up 12,000% in the past year. Investors on Twitter and Reddit early in the year jumped in to encourage others to pile on.<br />The excitement swelled into a crowdsourced “Doge Day” in mid-April, when investors encouraged as many people as possible to buy the cryptocurrency and drive up its value. The social media-fueled rally drove the price up for a period of about 48 hours, followed by a dip and another rally in early May."
