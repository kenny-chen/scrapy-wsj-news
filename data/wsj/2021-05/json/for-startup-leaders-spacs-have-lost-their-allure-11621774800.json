    "body": "Startup chief executives are turning a cold shoulder to SPACs.<br />Skeptical CEOs say they are turning down offers from special-purpose acquisition companies, deleting their solicitous emails and tapping the brakes on merger deals amid nosediving shares and disappointed investors.<br />So-called blank-check companies, which go public with no assets and then merge with private companies, exploded in popularity last year as a mechanism for startups to raise a lot of money with more speed and fewer regulatory hurdles than a traditional initial public offering.<br />More recently, startup CEOs have watched many of their peers endure stock slides and earnings calls with disappointed investors in the weeks after finishing a SPAC deal. For many, it has been a bitter reality check that public-market investors might not be as generous as SPAC creators have been with early-stage companies with unpredictable revenue and growing pains.<br />“The reluctance is palpable,” said Adam J. Epstein, who advises startup CEOs and their boards. “It’s gone from being a bona fide alternative path to an IPO to ‘We don’t really want to be a punchline.’”"
