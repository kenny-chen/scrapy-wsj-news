    "body": "TEL AVIV—Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed to a cease-fire that began early Friday following pressure from the U.S. and its allies to end 11 days of fighting.<br />Israel’s cabinet voted late Thursday to accept an Egyptian-brokered bilateral cease-fire without any conditions, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office.<br />Hamas leader Osama Hamdan confirmed the cease-fire.<br />The intense barrages from both sides, over nearly two weeks, were the worst since the most recent of three wars between Israel and Hamas in 2014. The clashes over the past 11 days claimed the lives of more than 200 people in total, with most in Gaza.<br />In a sign of the challenges ahead, both sides gave a different version of the cease-fire terms. While Israel said the cease-fire deal involved no preconditions, Mr. Hamdan said Israel had agreed to stop its aggressive actions in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem and the Al Aqsa Mosque."
