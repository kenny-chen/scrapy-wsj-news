    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House narrowly passed a $1.9 billion supplemental spending bill to fund security at the Capitol, buy more police equipment and better protect members of Congress and federal judges, as well as to reimburse costs incurred in response to the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.<br />The legislation was approved 213-212, mostly along party lines. No Republicans voted in favor and six progressive Democrats declined to support the measure, causing some tense moments for vote counters on the floor as the margin grew narrower.<br />Reps. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), Cori Bush (D., Mo.) and Ayanna Pressley (D., Mass.) voted “no,” while Reps. Jamaal Bowman (D., N.Y.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) voted “present.”<br />Mses. Omar, Bush and Pressley said they objected to increasing police funding without addressing what they saw as the core drivers of the attack: violent white supremacy, radicalization and disinformation.<br />The bill next goes to the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain amid concerns about the militarization of the Capitol and the cost. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, has yet to endorse the amount of spending."
