    "body": "If a hotelier strikes you as an unlikely sponsor for a special-purpose acquisition company, you don’t know  Accor .<br />The French company, whose chains include Fairmont and Sofitel, said Thursday that it wanted to launch a SPAC on the Paris stock exchange. The shell company would be worth about €300 million ($366 million) and scout for targets focused on food and drink, flexible working and events, among other sectors.<br />SPACs are typically associated with American business tycoons. As a company, and a European one, Accor would be an unusual sponsor. It is also late to the party: Appetite for SPACs in the U.S. has collapsed in recent months.<br />Yet the move isn’t out of character. Accor has earned a reputation as the hotel industry’s most enthusiastic corporate buyer in recent years. French newspaper Le Figaro reported last August that Accor was even studying a bid for  Intercontinental Hotels ,  owner of Holiday Inn—a move that would finally give the French company the big U.S. business it craves.<br />Accor’s “augmented hospitality” strategy involves attracting all manner of business to its hotels, from fine dining to workspace providing. The SPAC could bring it a new client at little cost and most likely a profit. Sponsoring the vehicles has been a lucrative business, controversially so."
