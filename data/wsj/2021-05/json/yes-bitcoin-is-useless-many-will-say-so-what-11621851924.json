    "body": "The chances that bitcoin will ever become real money or make a productive contribution to society seem close to nil. Then again, the same is true for so many things in life.<br />On Monday, the price of bitcoin found some footing after a turbulent weekend, rising to almost $37,000—still a painful 37% drop from the start of the month. Investors are engaged in the rational but onerous task of figuring out whether virtual currencies are immensely valuable because they can threaten governments’ fiat money, or just worthless digital tokens.<br />Lately, their price has seemed to fluctuate at the whim of a single man: prominent crypto cheerleader and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk. This month, he said his company will no longer accept bitcoin as payment for electric cars, allegedly because of the emissions generated by computers verifying transactions and “mining” tokens. One estimate puts bitcoin’s massive carbon footprint on a par with Portugal’s.<br />There is probably another reason. While Tesla has pledged not to sell its stash of bitcoins, getting paid in a noncash volatile asset poses accounting problems for any company.<br />Ultimately, cryptocurrencies have no convincing use case. As a means of payment, they are a slower, more pollutive alternative to bank transfers."
