    "body": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party fell far short in its attempt to win control in a fiercely contested state election, one in which its aggressive efforts to get out the vote have been criticized as worsening the country’s surge in Covid-19 infections.<br />Official results coming in early Monday showed Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was poised to win as many as 77 seats in the West Bengal state legislature—a sharp pickup from its previous showings but well short of a majority of the 292 seats being contested.<br />The state’s governing Trinamool Congress party was on track to win as many as 213 seats. The party is led by Mamata Banerjee, a powerful regional politician who has at times been an outspoken critic of Mr. Modi.<br />Mr. Modi and other politicians drew criticism for holding campaign rallies attended by tens of thousands as a Covid-19 wave accelerated.<br />On Saturday, new cases in India topped 400,000 a day, a global record, amid a surge that has overwhelmed the healthcare system in hard-hit cities like New Delhi and spread to other states across the country. Hospitals have been turning patients away and running out of oxygen and Covid-19 medications, leaving sick people to care for their even sicker family members."
