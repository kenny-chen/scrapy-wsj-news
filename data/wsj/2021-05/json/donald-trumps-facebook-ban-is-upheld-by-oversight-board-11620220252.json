    "body": "Facebook Inc.  was justified in banning then-President Donald Trump, the company’s independent oversight board ruled Wednesday, but didn’t appropriately explain if or why the former president should be permanently locked out of the social-media platform.<br />The board gave Facebook six months to determine whether Mr. Trump should be permanently banned and, if so, to explain that decision more fully.<br />The decision, which is binding, largely ratifies a choice personally approved by Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in the wake of the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot and could have far-reaching implications for how technology companies police political speech.<br />“The Board found that, in maintaining an unfounded narrative of electoral fraud and persistent calls to action, Mr. Trump created an environment where a serious risk of violence was possible,” the board’s opinion stated. “At the time of Mr. Trump’s posts, there was a clear, immediate risk of harm and his words of support for those involved in the riots legitimized their violent actions.”<br />Nonetheless, the board was also critical of Facebook for failing to offer Mr. Trump due process when it settled on an indefinite suspension of his account."
