    "body": "DoorDash  Inc.’s  revenue tripled in the first quarter, showing sustained demand for food-delivery services even as coronavirus vaccinations picked up and the nation moved toward reopening.<br />The San Francisco-based company reported revenue of $1.08 billion for the three months through March, up from $362 million in the same quarter a year earlier, beating Wall Street’s forecast. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected revenue of $994 million.<br />“The negative impact that we were expecting in consumer behavior was smaller than we were anticipating,” Chief Financial Officer Prabir Adarkar said in an interview Thursday. The company’s better-than-expected revenue helped drive shares up nearly 8% in after-hours trading.<br />While DoorDash slightly narrowed its loss to $110 million from a loss of $129 million in the same quarter last year, the figure missed analysts’ projections of a $63 million loss. Mr. Adarkar said the company was focused on investing in growth and capitalizing on the shift in consumer behavior in the near term.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic served as an unexpected boon for DoorDash. The company gobbled up more than half of the U.S. food-delivery market in January, up from just over one-third a year ago, according to market research firm Edison Trends. Analysts say the company leapfrogged its rivals thanks to a strong footprint in the suburbs, a wider selection of restaurants and greater operational efficiency in delivering the food itself."
