    "body": "U.S. home prices rose nearly everywhere in the first quarter, a rapid price appreciation that shows little sign of fading soon with limited housing inventory and robust demand.<br />The median sales price for existing single-family homes was higher in the quarter compared with a year earlier for 182 of the 183 metro areas tracked by the National Association of Realtors, the group said Tuesday. In 89% of those metro areas, median prices rose by more than 10% from a year earlier.<br />This weekâ€™s price data was the latest confirmation that the pandemic continues to reshape how and where many Americans want to live. Remote work prompted buyers to seek out more space, while pandemic-related restrictions made vacation houses more desirable, real-estate agents said.<br />The home-sales boom has been unusually widespread, with low mortgage rates fueling strong buyer interest across the U.S., especially for high-end properties.<br />But first-time buyers in particular have struggled to keep up with soaring prices, and those with limited budgets are often losing out to cash buyers. The length of time U.S. homeowners stay put, meanwhile, has been steadily rising. Some have decided not to move, or they postponed selling because of concerns about letting buyers into their homes during a pandemic."
