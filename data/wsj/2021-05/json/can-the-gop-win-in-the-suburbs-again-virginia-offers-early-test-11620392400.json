    "body": "Republican officials and activists in Virginia will gather Saturday to choose their gubernatorial nominee, the party’s first major effort during President Biden’s tenure to win back voters in a state where Democrats made significant gains during Donald Trump’s presidency.<br />Many in the GOP are optimistic about keeping this fall’s race for governor competitive, citing historical trends that suggest Virginians tend to use their off-year gubernatorial elections as a check on the most recent presidential election. Since the late 1970s, only once have Virginians elected a governor of the same party as the White House occupant: Democrat Terry McAuliffe. He won the governor’s mansion in 2013, a year after former President Barack Obama, who carried Virginia, cruised to re-election. Mr. McAuliffe is a leading contender for his party’s nomination this year, as Democrats try to repeat that history.<br />Instead of holding an open primary, Virginia Republicans are picking their nominee at a convention via a ranked-choice voting system, with delegates gathering to make their choices at dozens of locations around the state. Results aren’t expected to be tallied and made public until next week.<br />The top Republican contenders, according to recent public polling, are Glenn Youngkin, who stepped down last year as co-chief executive of the  Carlyle Group Inc. ; Pete Snyder, an entrepreneur and longtime GOP fundraiser who previously ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor; Amanda Chase, a state legislator who has described herself as “Trump in heels”; and Kirk Cox, former speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates.<br />Former Virginia GOP officials—including those from the state’s northern parts, where proximity to Washington, D.C., and growth have helped accelerate widespread Democratic victories—say Republicans risk a Democratic win if they nominate a candidate too closely aligned with Mr. Trump. He lost Virginia by 10 percentage points in 2020 after falling roughly 5 points short in 2016."
