    "body": "Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.  sold its first dollar bonds in more than two decades, seizing on debt investors’ willingness to fund pandemic-ravaged airlines as the industry’s prospects improve.<br />Hong Kong’s flagship carrier sold a $650 million bond due in 2026, according to a term sheet issued late Monday that was seen by The Wall Street Journal. The bond was issued with a yield of 4.875%, lower than initial guidance of 5.2%, pointing to robust demand.<br />Last June, Cathay Pacific received a roughly $5 billion bailout from the Hong Kong government and other investors, including top shareholders  Swire Pacific Ltd. ,  Air China Ltd.  and Qatar Airways Co. The airline received bridge loans and issued new shares and preference shares as part of the funding package.<br />That fundraising was followed by restructuring that cut thousands of jobs and shut a subsidiary airline, and a sale of convertible bonds in January that raised 6.74 billion Hong Kong dollars, the equivalent of $868 million.<br />Cathay swung to a net loss of HK$21.65 billion in 2020. Analysts on average expect its loss to narrow to about HK$8.5 billion in 2021, according to estimates compiled by FactSet, and for it to return to profitability next year."
