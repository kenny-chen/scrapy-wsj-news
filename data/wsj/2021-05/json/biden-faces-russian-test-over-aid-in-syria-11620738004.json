    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is bracing for a showdown with Russia over the delivery of United Nations aid to millions of Syrians outside the control of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a flow that Moscow is poised to block in July.<br />At stake is the U.N.’s use of the Bab al-Hawa border crossing between Syria and Turkey, which the world body has used to send about 1,000 truckloads of aid a month to a region in northwest Syria with a population of more than four million.<br />The U.S. and its allies say the closure of the border to the U.N. would put civilians in jeopardy, especially the 2.7 million people in the area who have been displaced by the conflict. The U.N. also has just started its Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the area, an effort not easily replaced by another organization.<br />Moscow says, however, that the crossing is a violation of the Syrian government’s sovereignty and that assistance should be delivered from areas controlled by the regime, which has gained the upper hand against the opposition with the help of Russia and Iran after a decade of civil war.<br />“It’s clear that the stakes are quite high,” said a U.S. official at the U.N. “We’ll be actively engaged both with like-minded countries who are standing with us on this and with others who have expressed some skepticism.”"
