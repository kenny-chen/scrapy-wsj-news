    "body": "Police in California arrested the driver of a Tesla for allegedly operating the vehicle from the back seat.<br />The California Highway Patrol said Wednesday it had arrested 25-year-old Param Sharma for reckless driving of a  Tesla Inc.  Model 3 on Interstate 80 in the Bay Area. Mr. Sharma couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.<br />Police said they had received 911 calls about the driver. The officer in Wednesday’s arrest saw the driver, the lone occupant of the car, seated in the back seat, police said. Mr. Sharma moved to the driver’s seat and stopped the car on the shoulder of the interstate, where he was arrested, the police said.<br />Mr. Sharma was charged with two counts of reckless driving and disobeying an officer. He also was cited with using his vehicle in a reckless manner last month, the police said.<br />The incident is the latest to raise questions about how some Tesla drivers use their vehicles, including the advanced driver-assistance features the company offers."
