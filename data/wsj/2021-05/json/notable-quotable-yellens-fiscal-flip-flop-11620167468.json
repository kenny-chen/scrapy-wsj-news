    "body": "Future Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen writing in a symposium for the September/October 1999 issue of the International Economy:<br /><br />During the past four years, productivity in the nonfarm sector has grown at a remarkable 2.0 percent pace, up sharply from its 1.2 percent rate (adjusted for methodology changes) over the previous four years. The implications have already been far reaching, helping to suppress inflation, boost profits, and sustain solid gains in real wages after nine years of stagnation. . . .<br />One factor which accounts for part of the productivity surge is the investment boom which has driven the latter part of the expansion, the consequence of an historic shift in the stance of fiscal policy. The switch from chronic and growing deficits in the federal budget to surpluses has boosted national saving, cut interest rates, and spurred private investment. . . . Only time will tell if recent productivity trends can [be] sustained. We can improve the odds by maintaining the fiscal discipline which is responsible for our investment boom."
