    "body": "WASHINGTON—The federal government is launching a temporary $3.2 billion program to help needy American families pay for high-speed internet service, in what could also be a boon for telecommunications providers.<br />The Emergency Broadband Benefit program opens for enrollment Wednesday and generally offers $50 a month to help eligible households pay their internet or mobile phone bills.<br />More than 825 providers have signed up to offer service through the program, from giants such as  Comcast Corp.  and  AT&T Inc.  to smaller players such as  Dish Network Corp.’s  Boost Mobile, according to the Federal Communications Commission.<br />Jeff Moore, principal at industry research firm Wave7 Research, said he expects carriers to capitalize on the program by seeking new customers and pushing upgrades to existing ones.<br />“There will be a surge of orders and a surge of business for the carriers, so that’s a short-term positive for them,” he said. “It’s a $50 benefit per month, and who’s not going to like that?”"
