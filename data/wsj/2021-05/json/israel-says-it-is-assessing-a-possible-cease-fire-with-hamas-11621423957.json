    "body": "TEL AVIV—Israel is assessing the conditions for a cease-fire, a senior Israeli military official said Wednesday, after an intense 10-day air and artillery campaign against Hamas in Gaza met a growing chorus of calls for a halt to the deadly conflict.<br />“We are now assessing whether the achievements are enough to bring the message to Hamas,” the official said. “We can go more days, more weeks…we have a very good bank of targets.”<br />The official said Israel wants to see an agreement to end fighting which includes international pressure on Hamas to address its ability to build up its forces and the return of the bodies of two soldiers who went missing in the 2014 war.<br />Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Benny Gantz and military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Aviv Kohavi are holding ongoing discussions on whether Hamas has been sufficiently deterred by the operation, the official said.<br />The Israeli military has launched hundreds of airstrikes in Gaza, aimed at what it says are Hamas’s military infrastructure and personnel. Israel’s military says it has killed 130 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants so far, and destroyed all of their rocket manufacturing sites and 100 kilometers of an underground tunnel system that Israel says the militant group uses to maneuver and launch attacks."
