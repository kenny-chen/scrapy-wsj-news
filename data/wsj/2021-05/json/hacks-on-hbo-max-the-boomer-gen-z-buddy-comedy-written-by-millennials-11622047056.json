    "body": "In the HBO Max series “Hacks,” two comedians—one in her 60s, one in her 20s—struggle to bridge the generation gap dividing them.<br />In one recent scene, Deborah, a veteran Las Vegas comedian played by Jean Smart, is promoting a pizza franchise, one of her many side jobs as a well-paid shill. “A gig’s a gig, honey,” she says to the mortified Ava (Hannah Einbinder), a young comedy writer hired to punch up Deborah’s material.<br /><br />This clash is par for the course in “Hacks,” an odd-couple story about comedy that largely plays out away from the stage. The two women have disagreed over the need for traditional punchlines and about political correctness. Now as the series reaches the halfway point of its season, the creators say the characters are both facing the same enduring questions about what women are willing to do for laughs and who they roast in the process.<br />“In some ways these characters have so much in common. They speak the same language as funny women. On the other hand, their context is vastly different,” says Lucia Aniello, who created the series with Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky. Their work together includes the TV series “Broad City,” an influential buddy comedy about two millennial ladies in New York."
