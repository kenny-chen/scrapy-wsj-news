    "body": "WarnerMedia Chief Executive Officer Jason Kilar said in a companywide address Thursday that he has no plans to step down this year in the wake of  AT&T Inc.’s  decision to spin off and merge the media company with  Discovery Inc.,  a person familiar with his remarks said.<br />Mr. Kilar’s future as head of WarnerMedia was called into question after AT&T and Discovery unveiled their plans last week. He wasn’t kept in the loop about the pending deal, people with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Kilar said he would reassess his options next year.<br />Speaking Thursday during a town hall meeting to celebrate the first anniversary of streaming service HBO Max, Mr. Kilar said: “My plan and my focus is to remain here in my CEO role at WarnerMedia. I am not thinking right now about postmerger. There will be a time to consider that topic in 2022.”<br />Mr. Kilar added, “I believe we have unfinished business, and the work of the next year can and should be extremely fulfilling as the world continues to see what we are capable of doing.”<br />AT&T CEO John Stankey said in a statement Thursday, “Jason’s leadership and capabilities have been central to positioning WarnerMedia for renewed growth, and I am excited about what we will see during his second year at the helm.”"
