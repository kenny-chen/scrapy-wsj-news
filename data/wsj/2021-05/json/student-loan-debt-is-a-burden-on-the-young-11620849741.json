    "body": "Regarding “Inside the Fight Over Student Loan Losses” (Page One, April 30): It is time for the federal government to get out of the student-loan business. Since 1992, easy-to-secure federal student loans gave schools the green light to significantly raise tuition and fees. Higher costs made higher education less affordable. Now we find that taxpayers will be on the hook for billions of unpaid loans. How about if the schools themselves become the lenders? They could decide how to qualify student borrowers based on their credit scores and their projected ability to repay, perhaps tied to the earning potential of their degree.<br />Tom Leinbach<br />Charlottesville, Va.<br /><br />Student debt has eviscerated the fundamental American dream to better oneself and achieve through developing one’s talents via education. This is exacerbated by two main factors: the exorbitant interest rates and additional terms of the loans fueled by spiraling tuition costs while more overpaid administrators are layered into the education bureaucracy as teachers are relegated to part-time contractors."
