    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate leaders battled in a committee hearing Tuesday over sweeping Democratic-backed election legislation that would rewrite rules covering voting procedures, campaign finance and election oversight.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said the Democrats’ aim was to expand voting access at a time when, he said, Republican-led state legislatures were writing laws to make it harder for students, African-Americans and Latinos to vote.<br />“When you lose an election, you try to persuade more voters to vote for you,” Mr. Schumer said at the Senate Rules Committee hearing, taking a jab at Republicans. “You don’t try to ban the other side from voting.”<br />Republicans say those state-level efforts are aimed at tightening voting rules to combat fraud. At the same hearing, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Democrats were pursuing the voting legislation in Congress in a way that would reduce Americans’ confidence in the accuracy and fairness of elections, such as by removing voter ID requirements.<br />“Why are Democrats so hell bent on doing whatever it takes to rewire our democracy on a thoroughly partisan basis?” Mr. McConnell asked."
