    "body": "As hospitals throughout India put out pleas on social media for more oxygen, the country has pressed its national railways and air force to speed distribution. International aid has flowed in.<br />But it hasn’t been enough.<br />“We have just run out of oxygen. We are currently surviving on some oxygen cylinders. Over the next 10 minutes that will also run out. We are again in a crisis mode,” Sudhanshu Bankata, executive director of New Delhi’s Batra Hospital, said on Saturday afternoon, in a video the hospital released to the media.<br />Dr. Bankata had already alerted government officials via WhatsApp groups set up to monitor oxygen levels in the capital’s hospitals. The oxygen tanker trucks en route, he said in the video, were “quite far away from our hospital.”<br />The hospital remained without oxygen for an hour and 20 minutes. He said 12 patients died from a lack of oxygen, including R.K. Himthani, head of the hospital’s gastroenterology department."
