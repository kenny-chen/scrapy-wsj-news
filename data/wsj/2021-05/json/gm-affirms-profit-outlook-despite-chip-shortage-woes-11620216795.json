    "body": "General Motors Co.  said it expects to hit the high range of its 2021 profit forecast despite the vexing computer-chip shortage, as strong pricing and brisk new-vehicle demand offset supply woes.<br />GM reiterated its guidance Wednesday while reporting first-quarter net profit rose hit $3.02 billion, compared with about $300 million a year earlier, when the pandemic disrupted operations. The company said the semiconductor shortage will hurt second-quarter output, but the company will continue to give priority to its most profitable vehicles, large pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles.<br />The nation’s largest auto maker by sales said pretax profit adjusted for one-time items hit $4.42 billion, equivalent to $2.25 a share. That beat the $1.05 average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet.<br />Revenue was $32.5 billion for the first quarter, compared with $32.7 billion a year earlier.<br />GM said it is confident that it will hit the high end of its previously issued guidance of $10 billion to $11 billion for the year, even as the impact from the semiconductor shortage cuts as much as $2 billion from the bottom line."
