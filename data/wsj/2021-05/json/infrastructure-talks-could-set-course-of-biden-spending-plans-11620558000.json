    "body": "<br />WASHINGTON—President Biden faces a crucial test this week of whether he can find any common ground with Republicans as he pushes trillions in spending on infrastructure, child care and education.<br />The president is hosting top lawmakers at the White House to chart a path forward amid mounting GOP opposition to his agenda and calls from some Democrats to move his proposals through Congress without Republican support.<br />The president has called for more than $4 trillion in spending across two proposals: a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan centered on fixing roads and bridges, expanding broadband internet access and boosting funding for research and development, and a $1.8 trillion plan that would extend the expanded child tax credit, and provide for tuition-free community college and prekindergarten. The plans would be paid for through increased taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans.<br />On Wednesday, Mr. Biden will hold his first formal meeting since taking office with top congressional leaders: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). The meeting will touch on several topics, but is expected to focus in part on the president’s spending proposals, White House aides said."
