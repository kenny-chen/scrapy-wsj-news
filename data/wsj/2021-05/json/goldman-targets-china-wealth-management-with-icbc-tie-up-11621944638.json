    "body": "Chinese regulators have approved a wealth-management joint venture between  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , as China further opens up its lucrative financial sector to foreign banks.<br />Goldman’s asset-management arm will own 51% of the venture, and the remainder will be held by an ICBC wealth-management subsidiary, the New York-based bank said Tuesday.<br />ICBC, one of China’s largest state-owned banks, said the venture will help it provide more diversified and professional wealth-management services and would improve the bank’s ability to serve the real economy.<br />In China, wealth-management businesses run by banks typically sell investment products to a range of individuals. Goldman on Tuesday cited its own research estimating that investible assets held by Chinese households could surpass $70 trillion by 2030. About 60% of that could be allocated to nondeposit products including securities, mutual funds and wealth-management products, the firm said.<br />Goldman said the new venture has received preliminary approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and it intends to develop a range of investment products for the China market. That would include “quantitative investment strategies, cross-border products and innovative solutions in alternatives,” Goldman said."
