    "body": "WASHINGTON—Rep. Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.) embraced former President Donald Trump and his supporters as critical to Republicans’ success at the ballot box, seeking to quiet critics who raised concerns about her voting record as she seeks a top position in party leadership.<br />Ms. Stefanik’s stance on Mr. Trump contrasts sharply with that of Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), the embattled chairman of the House Republican conference whom she is hoping to succeed. This week, House GOP leaders aired their frustration with Ms. Cheney, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump over his baseless claims that the election was stolen from him. She has urged the party to distance itself from the former president.<br />In comments to Steve Bannon’s “War Room” broadcast on Thursday, Ms. Stefanik emphasized party unity and said Mr. Trump’s populist coalition of voters was key to winning back control of the House next year.<br />“This is also about being one team,” she said, adding that she was “proud to stand up for President Trump.”<br />Ms. Stefanik, who was sometimes critical of Mr. Trump when he was a candidate but then became an outspoken defender during his first impeachment, also joined with Mr. Trump and other Republicans in questioning the November election result. Ms. Stefanik objected to some Biden electors during the Jan. 6 session of Congress certifying President Biden’s victory that was interrupted by the pro-Trump Capitol riot."
