    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Commission charged S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC forwith failing to properly oversee a volatility-related index that landed at the center of market turmoil in February 2018.<br />The civil charge pertains to the S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Index, which fed into the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term Exchange-Traded Note. The once-popular exchange-traded note, overseen by  Credit Suisse Group AG , left investors with big losses during a bout of market volatility.<br />Exchange-traded products based on volatility swelled in popularity over the past decade, and the Credit Suisse note, known by its ticker XIV, had been a favorite among investors who sought to profit from a decline in volatility—a lucrative but dangerous wager.<br />In February 2018, the note faced big losses as volatility roared back, and the central role that exchange-traded products like XIV played led the period to be called “Volmageddon.” The SEC’s latest charges reveal how the index behind the product was riddled with problems.<br />The SEC said S&P Dow Jones Indices didn’t have enough people available to monitor the index and didn’t follow the company’s procedures for index monitoring. S&P agreed to pay a $9-million penalty to settle the charges with the regulator."
