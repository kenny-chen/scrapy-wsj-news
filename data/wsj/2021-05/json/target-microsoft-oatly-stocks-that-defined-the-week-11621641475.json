The Wall Street Journal reported on May 16 that some of the tech giant’s board members decided that Mr. Gates needed to step down from its board in 2020, as they pursued an investigation into the billionaire’s prior romantic relationship with a female employee that was deemed inappropriate. Members of the board tasked with the matter had hired a law firm to conduct an investigation in late 2019. Mr. Gates resigned before the investigation was completed and before the full board could make a formal decision on the matter. Microsoft shares lost 1.2% Monday.<br />AT&T Inc."
