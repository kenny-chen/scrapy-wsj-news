    "body": "Bright Machines is nearing a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company to go public in a deal that would value the manufacturing-automation business at about $1.6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The creator of a platform that uses artificial intelligence and robotics to automate tasks in electronics manufacturing, Bright Machines is close to a deal with  SCVX Corp. , the people said. The merger could be announced as soon as this week.<br />Founded in 2018, Bright Machines says that its “microfactories” can be programmed to complete electronics-manufacturing tasks and continue improving as they repeat them. They make supply chains more efficient, removing the need for as many human workers and saving resources in many technology-dependent industries, the company says.<br />The San Francisco-based company currently has about 25 customers, according to its website. Its existing investors include BMW iVentures—the venture-capital arm of auto maker BMW AG—Eclipse Ventures and Lux Capital.<br />If the deal is completed, Bright Machines would be expected to generate about $435 million in cash proceeds from the roughly $230 million held by the SPAC and $205 million from a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, associated with the merger, the people said.  SoftBank Group Corp.  and Fidelity Investments are expected to participate in the PIPE."
