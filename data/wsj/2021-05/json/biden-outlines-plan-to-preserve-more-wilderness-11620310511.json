    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration wants to preserve wildlife habitats by expanding collaboration with private landowners and state and local governments, with less emphasis on putting more land under federal protection, according to a report issued Thursday.<br />The report, “Conserving and Restoring America the Beautiful,” provides a preliminary outline of how the administration can pursue a goal President Biden has set to conserve 30% of the country’s land and water by 2030.<br />Mr. Biden adopted the 30% target from scientists and environmentalists who say it can help stem animal and plant extinctions, threats to water and food supplies and other environmental crises.<br />About 12% of U.S. land and roughly 23% of U.S. ocean territory is currently under permanent, strong protection, according to the Interior Department, which is leading the administration’s effort.<br />The report recommends that the National Park Service expand efforts to create new parks in communities with historically limited access to nature."
