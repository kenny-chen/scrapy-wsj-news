    "body": "Regarding Heather Mac Donald’s “Anticop Movement Wants Road Anarchy Too” (op-ed, April 23): Politeness can go a long way during a traffic stop. The majority of cops are doing a very good job protecting the public. Many are understandably nervous. And why not? Too many of them are getting killed in the line of duty. Effective law enforcement must be a partnership between the citizens and the police.<br />During a traffic stop the cop is in control, but you set the tone. Nobody likes getting pulled over, and truth be told, most cops don’t like making traffic stops, because they are dangerous. Don’t go very far when pulled over, because that will raise red flags. If it’s dark, turn on the interior lights, roll down your window and sit still with your hands on the steering wheel and be patient. The cop knows nothing about you. While there are some angry cops out there, most are good-natured and amiable. They react to what goes on around them. Start by being polite and answering the officer’s questions. If you are carrying a gun, let the officer know. The officer coming up to your window has no idea what is going to happen next. Help him make the right choice. It isn’t worth losing your life over a traffic stop.<br />Dan Nathan<br />Westlake Village, Calif."
