    "body": "WASHINGTON—U.S. and Mexican labor groups filed a complaint against a Mexican auto-parts manufacturer, alleging that it violated the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement by suppressing its workers’ rights to unionize.<br />The complaint, filed Monday with the U.S. government, is the first case that seeks to use a new labor-dispute provision of the USMCA trade agreement signed into law last year by former President Donald Trump with bipartisan support.<br />The complaint provides an early test of President Biden’s pledge to press for strict adherence to labor and environmental rules under existing trade agreements.<br />A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, which will be one of the agencies reviewing the complaint, said the agency would carefully review it. Mexico’s Economy Ministry said it hadn’t been notified of the complaint and had no comment.<br />The complaint from the labor groups led by AFL-CIO alleges that Tridonex, an auto-parts factory located in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, “harassed and fired” workers who were trying to organize with a Mexican labor group seeking to improve wages and working conditions."
