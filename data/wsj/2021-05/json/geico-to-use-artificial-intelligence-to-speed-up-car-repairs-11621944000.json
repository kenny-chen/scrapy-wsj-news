    "body": "Geico, the nation’s second-biggest auto insurer, will try to speed up vehicle repairs for its policyholders by running photographs of damaged vehicles through artificial-intelligence software.<br />Berkshire Hathaway Inc. -owned Geico will offer the quick-estimate process in partnership with Tractable Ltd., said Alex Dalyac, chief executive and founder of the London-based technology firm. Tractable is among a number of specialists trying to help car insurers use artificial intelligence and other techniques to eliminate time-consuming hassles when customers file accident claims.<br />Financial terms of the partnership weren’t disclosed.<br />Todd Combs, Geico’s chief executive, said in a written statement that Tractable’s technology is a way to obtain accurate estimates for policyholders and get drivers back on the road faster.<br />Geico is second in the private-passenger auto-insurance market, with a 13.6% share, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Geico’s size as a part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire conglomerate means its moves are often followed by other car insurers, so its use of artificial intelligence in handling claims could become standard industry practice."
