    "body": "Epic Games Inc.’s courtroom battle against  Apple Inc.  is expected to end Monday with a debate-style format in which the judge will drill each side with questions about their cases.<br />The trial’s outcome will reverberate far outside the Oakland, Calif., courtroom as Apple faces scrutiny from lawmakers, regulators and software developers who say the company exercises too much control and restricts competition within its App Store. Apple has pushed back against those claims, pointing to the competition it faces from other app stores and devices and the company’s desire to provide a seamless experience for users.<br />The judge is expected to rule in the coming months.<br />During the three-week trial, Epic has argued Apple is improperly blocking third-party app stores on its mobile devices and forcing developers to use its in-app payment system for all digital transactions, allowing it to collect a commission as high as 30%.<br />In response, Apple has said there are many ways for users to access Epic’s “Fortnite” videogame and that its commission is in line with what other platforms take. Apple has argued that Epic is merely trying to take advantage of Apple’s investment and store without paying its fair share."
