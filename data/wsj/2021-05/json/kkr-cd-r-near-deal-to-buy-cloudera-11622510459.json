    "body": "Private-equity firms KKR & Co. and Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC are nearing a deal to buy  Cloudera Inc.  and take the software company private, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />A deal for the data-cloud company could be finalized by Tuesday, assuming the talks don’t fall apart at the last minute, the people said. The exact terms couldn’t be learned, but the company has a market value of nearly $4 billion.<br />Founded in 2008 by a group of engineers from  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, Facebook  Oracle Corp.  and Yahoo Inc., Cloudera was an early player in the open-source software framework Hadoop, which enables large amounts of data to be processed quickly. But it struggled to shift to the now-dominant public cloud, where it faces steep competition from much larger firms including  Amazon.com Inc.’s  Amazon Web Services.<br />Cloudera’s shares have had a rocky run since their public-market debut in 2017. They are trading below their initial public offering price and are down roughly 8% so far this year after closing Friday at $12.86.<br />Still, recent results have shown improvement in the company’s business. Cloudera in March reported revenue of $869 million for its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, an increase of 9%, and an operating margin of 17% compared with a negative one a year earlier. It is scheduled to report first-quarter results this week."
