    "body": "Credit Suisse Group AG  is facing an exodus of senior investment bankers in the wake of a $5.5 billion loss tied to the meltdown of Archegos Capital Management.<br />At least 10 managing directors in the Swiss firm’s U.S. investment-banking division have internally disclosed plans to leave, most for rival firms, according to people familiar with the matter. Other bankers are considering their options, and more are expected to depart in the coming weeks.<br />Investments held by Archegos, a family investment vehicle for Bill Hwang, plummeted in late March, forcing Credit Suisse and other banks to sell large stock positions at losses. Credit Suisse lent more to Archegos relative to its size than others and was one of the last to exit the positions, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.<br />The debacle, coming on the heels of Credit Suisse’s involvement with the now-insolvent financing firm Greensill, forced the bank to cut its dividend and raise fresh capital from investors to shore up its balance sheet. The Swiss bank ousted top executives in the wake of the loss.<br />As information trickled out foreshadowing the big hit to the bank, competitors on Wall Street and recruiters began circling. The timing was fortuitous for the firm’s rivals, as recruiting typically ramps up after annual bonuses are paid early in the year."
