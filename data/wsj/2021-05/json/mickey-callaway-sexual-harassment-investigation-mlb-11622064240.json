    "body": "Mickey Callaway, the Los Angeles Angels pitching coach and former New York Mets manager, was on Wednesday banned by Major League Baseball through at least the 2022 season following an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment during his time in New York.<br />Callaway had been suspended by the Angels earlier this year and was placed under investigation by the league office after reports of his behavior surfaced in The Athletic on Feb. 1. Five women working in sports media had alleged that he had made inappropriate advances to them, including sending them unsolicited text messages and photos. Callaway denied any wrongdoing at the time.<br />Moments after the league’s announcement on Wednesday, the Angels said they had fired him.<br />“I apologize to the women who shared with investigators any interaction that made them feel uncomfortable,” Callaway said in a statement. “However, those are my own blind spots, and I take responsibility for the consequences.”<br />In a statement, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Callaway violated the league’s policies and would be placed on the ineligible list through, at least, the end of the 2022 season, at which point he can apply for reinstatement. Manfred said the clubs that employed Callaway fully cooperated with the league’s investigation."
