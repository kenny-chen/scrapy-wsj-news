    "body": "A cyberattack forced the largest U.S. fuel pipeline to shut down over the weekend, threatening to crimp Southeast U.S. supplies and raise prices if the pipeline isn’t brought back online soon.<br />Colonial Pipeline Co., operator of the 5,500-mile conduit for gasoline, diesel fuel and other refined products to the East Coast, on Monday said it was bringing segments of the pipeline back online and it hoped to substantially restore operational service by the end of the week.<br />Given that the pipeline will take at least several more days to come back into service, prices at the pump could rise as inventories of gasoline are reduced in states expected to be particularly hard-hit, including Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, analysts said.<br />The pipeline supplies about 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to the company’s website. It runs from the Gulf Coast to Linden, N.J.<br />It isn’t the first cyberattack that  the U.S. energy industry has suffered, but it is a dramatic example of what can happen when malicious software affects the computer systems of an energy company. The energy industry is a big target, with 2.5 million miles of pipelines and a vast array of sensors, valves, leak-detection tools and other systems linked not only to pipelines but also to refineries and power plants."
