    "body": "Boeing Co.  has halted deliveries of its 787 Dreamliners, adding fresh delays for customers following a recent five-month suspension in handing over the aircraft due to production problems, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Federal air-safety regulators have requested more information about Boeing’s proposed solution to address the previously identified quality lapses, these people said.<br />It wasn’t clear how long the halt might last, these people said.  American Airlines Group Inc.  was slated to receive a new Dreamliner this week, but that delivery isn’t expected until next week at the earliest, one of these people said.<br />A Boeing spokesman said the company was working in a timely and transparent manner to provide regulators with more information related to undelivered 787s.<br />The temporary halt could further pressure Boeing’s finances, as customers typically pay the bulk of an aircraft’s price on receipt, and disrupt airlines’ plans as travel demand picks up along with rising Covid-19 vaccinations."
