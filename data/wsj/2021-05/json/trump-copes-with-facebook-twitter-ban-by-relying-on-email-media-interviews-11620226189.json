    "body": "In the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump said, “I’m just not a believer in email.” Since he was banned from social media earlier this year, it has been his go-to communication tool.<br />Unable since January to tweet, put videos on YouTube or post to  Facebook —whose oversight board upheld the ban on Wednesday and gave the company six months to determine whether Mr. Trump should be permanently banned—the former president has been blast emailing statements to comment on daily news developments, endorse candidates and target critics.<br />He continues to claim in emailed statements and in private gatherings with supporters that the election was rigged. There is no evidence there was widespread fraud in the election, and Mr. Trump’s campaign and his allies failed in dozens of court challenges to the results.<br />“They’re really much more elegant. And the word is getting out,” Mr. Trump said of his emailed statements in a recent Newsmax interview.<br />“The tweeting gets you in trouble,” Mr. Trump added. “You’re retweeting people and you find out that the retweets were not so good, because the person—if you didn’t do research—that you’re retweeting is not the best. … I like this better than  Twitter .  Actually, they did us a favor.”"
