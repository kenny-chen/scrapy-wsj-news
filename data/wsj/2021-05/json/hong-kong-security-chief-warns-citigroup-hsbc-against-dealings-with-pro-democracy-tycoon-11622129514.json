    "body": "Hong Kong authorities issued warnings to units of  Citigroup Inc.  and  HSBC  Holdings PLC that their employees could face jail time if they deal with the accounts or assets of Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy newspaper owner charged with national-security offenses.<br />Mr. Lai, who is in his 70s, is currently serving a prison sentence for unauthorized assembly related to protests that erupted in the city in 2019. He is also awaiting trial on national-security charges amid China’s crackdown on dissent in the city.<br />Earlier this month, Hong Kong police froze Mr. Lai’s assets, including his majority stake in a popular pro-democracy newspaper, under a national-security law imposed last year by Beijing.<br />In letters dated May 14 that were separately addressed to the Hong Kong offices of Citibank and HSBC, Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said the banks must not directly or indirectly deal with the accounts of offshore companies owned by Mr. Lai without a license granted by the security minister.<br />Employees who “knowingly contravene the direction” would be deemed to have committed an offense and could be fined and jailed for seven years, according to two letters that were seen by The Wall Street Journal."
