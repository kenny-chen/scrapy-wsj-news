    "body": "Vice Media Group’s plan to go public later this year is coming into focus.<br />Under a proposed deal to merge with blank-check company  7GC & Co Holdings Inc.,  Vice would remove one of the biggest obstacles it has faced, onerous financial obligations to private-equity investor TPG, people familiar with the matter said.<br />The proposed transaction, valued at nearly $3 billion including debt, would leave existing shareholders—including TPG, Walt  Disney Co. , A&E Networks Group, merchant bank Raine Group and founder Shane Smith—with a combined 75% ownership of the company, the people said. The rest of the company would be owned by Vice’s new investors.<br />The nearly $3 billion valuation under consideration would be a discount compared with the $5.7 billion valuation set in Vice Media’s last major equity-investment round, a $450 million infusion from TPG in 2017.<br />7GC & Co Holdings, which was founded by tech investor Jack Leeney, is preparing to pitch institutional investors on the deal beginning this week, the people said. The blank-check company is hoping to complete the deal this summer, depending on how long it takes the Securities and Exchange Commission to review it."
