    "body": "Roughly half of New York voters support New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, as he faces down investigations into allegations of sexual harassment and his administration’s handling of Covid-19 in nursing homes, a poll released Monday shows.<br />Forty-nine percent of voters surveyed last week by the Siena College Research Institute said Mr. Cuomo shouldn’t resign, a slight decrease from the 51% of respondents who in April said the governor should stay.<br />The poll of 793 registered voters showed that Mr. Cuomo’s approval ratings appear to have stabilized since March, when many of his fellow Democrats called for him to step down and the Democrat-dominated state Assembly launched an investigation that could lead to his impeachment.<br />The key indicators in the latest survey offered a mixed bag for the governor. While the percentage of poll respondents who said he should resign increased, the share of voters who said they were prepared to re-elect him rose to 37%, from 33% in April. The governor’s favorability rating ticked up, but the percentage of poll respondents who approve of his management of the pandemic ticked down. The poll has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4 percentage points.<br />Poll spokesman Steven Greenberg said the situation was one where someone could perceive the governor’s political glass as either half empty or half full."
