    "body": "President Biden’s pick to lead a key agency that will be involved in the administration’s efforts to curb gun violence faced opposition Wednesday from Republican senators, as some cited his advocacy for tighter gun control laws.<br />David Chipman, if confirmed, would lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.<br />In an evenly divided Senate, Mr. Chipman needs to secure all 50 Democratic votes to be confirmed, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting a tiebreaking vote.<br />Mr. Chipman spent 25 years as an ATF agent and oversaw the bureau’s firearms programs, among other roles. Mr. Chipman most recently served as a top policy adviser to the gun-control organization Giffords, led by former Democratic Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in 2011 along with 18 others in a Tucson-area supermarket parking lot. Six people died in the attack.<br />At a hearing Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, (R., Iowa), the committee’s minority leader, likened Mr. Chipman’s nomination to “putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services.”"
