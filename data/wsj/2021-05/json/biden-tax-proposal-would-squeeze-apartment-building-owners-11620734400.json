    "body": "The Biden administration’s plan to limit a longstanding property-tax break could disrupt the business of investing in apartment buildings, discouraging both amateur and professional investors who helped fuel record multifamily sales.<br />The tax treatment enables investors to defer capital-gains taxes if they invest profits from a real-estate sale into another property. It is used to buy and sell most types of real estate, but it has been a primary source of capital for apartment-building investors. Multifamily sales enjoyed their biggest year ever in 2019, notching more than $184 billion of properties sold.<br />Karlin Conklin, principal of Investors Management Group, a company that purchases and renovates aging apartment complexes, said about one-third of the capital that her firm raises for acquisitions comes from these like-kind transactions, known as 1031 exchanges. Owing capital-gains taxes could mean less investment in existing affordable housing, she said.<br />“I think that the industry concern is that this will very much hamper transactions, and it will also then hamper reinvestment in improvements in local economies,” Ms. Conklin said.<br />President Biden proposed limiting the profits that investors can defer from 1031 exchanges to $500,000. U.S. investors save billions on their tax bills this way every year."
