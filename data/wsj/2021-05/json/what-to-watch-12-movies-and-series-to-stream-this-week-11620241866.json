    "body": "After spending years as a fixture in the writers’ room at “Saturday Night Live” and (mostly) out of the public eye, Paula Pell has become a regular in front of the camera. She is a series regular on “A.P. Bio” (Peacock), appeared in two episodes of “No Activity” (Paramount+), and last year she played a Jessica Fletcher-esque novelist/sleuth in “Mapleworth Murders,” a series on the now-defunct Quibi. This week she co-stars in the new series “Girls5eva” (see below).<br />Here’s what else is streaming this week:<br />( Apple  TV+)<br />Rob McElhenney runs an old show and a new show. The old one is “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” (Hulu), about a group of friends who run a bar and which, 14 seasons deep, is currently tied with “The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet” as the longest-running live-action sitcom in U.S. history. Mr. McElhenney calls the dark comedy “a show about people who never grow or learn anything or will ever change and evolve.”<br />The new one, “Mythic Quest,” is a workplace comedy that does almost the opposite: It’s about a company that makes video games where change, learning and being there for each other are central to the premise of the show. The second season, which takes place as the company returns to the office after working remotely during the pandemic, begins streaming Friday on Apple TV+."
