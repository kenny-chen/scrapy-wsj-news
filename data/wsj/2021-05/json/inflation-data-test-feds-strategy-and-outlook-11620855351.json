    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials have said increases in inflation this year will likely prove moderate and temporary, allowing them to hold interest rates near zero for years to come.<br />The recent surge in consumer prices, if it continues, could upend those plans.<br />If inflation remains persistently higher than they want, central bankers would have to abandon plans to keep their easy-money policies in place until the labor market is fully healed from the effects of the pandemic.<br />Some observers say the latest inflation figures show the Fed is already at risk of falling behind. So-called core prices, which exclude volatile components such as food and energy, rose 0.9% in April from March, the fastest one-month gain since 1981, the Labor Department said Wednesday.<br />Pershing Square Capital Management Chief Executive Bill Ackmanundefined, speaking at The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival Wednesday, said the Fed should rethink its policy stance."
