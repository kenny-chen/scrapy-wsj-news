    "body": "Coca-Cola Co.  is pulling the plug on its U.S. energy-drink experiment.<br />The soda giant started selling Coca-Cola Energy in the U.S. last year, hoping to break into a fast-growing beverage category that is dominated by Red Bull GmbH and  Monster Beverage Co.<br />But sales were disappointing. At the end of 2020, Coca-Cola Energy represented just 0.7% of U.S. energy-drink sales, according to Beverage Digest.<br />Coke will discontinue sales of the energy soda in the U.S. and Canada by the end of this year, a spokeswoman said Friday. The drink will remain available overseas, where it is sold mainly in Europe, she said. Beverage Digest earlier reported the move.<br />The drink has more than three times the caffeine of a regular Coke and contains guarana, a supplement popular in energy drinks."
