    "body": "It’s true that after the Jan. 6 invasion of the Capitol, several Republicans called for an investigative commission, but the one relevant truth is that Nancy Pelosi drove the idea into the ditch. Though the Senate may vote soon on the House bill, what’s left of the Jan. 6 commission should be loaded onto a flatbed truck and hauled to the political graveyard. It is unsalvageable.<br />Yes, let us agree it is a sad day when the American political system can’t summon sufficient agreement to establish the facts of a significant national trauma such as a right-wing mob marauding inside the Capitol. But it’s a sadder day still when what we nostalgically call “the facts” become the last thing our politics is interested in.<br />No alternative explanation is possible for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s remark on the impending Senate vote: “The American people will see where every member stands—on the side of truth or on the side of Donald Trump’s big lie.”<br />Years hence, historians sifting for the facts of American politics the past five years will have to address the phenomenon called Trump Derangement Syndrome.<br />Commonly, TDS refers to the damage done to individual psyches consumed with animosity toward Donald Trump, an effect he relished and fed. Less explored is the damage TDS did to the U.S. political system’s ability to function, as now with a Jan. 6 commission."
