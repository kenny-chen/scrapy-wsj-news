    "body": "Hey everyone, I’m up, I’m out of the dirt, it’s been 17 years, I’m chirping, I’m preparing to mate, I’m chirping again, I’m chirping some more, but I’m confused:<br />Everyone’s wearing surgical masks, everyone’s in sweatpants, nobody wears nice clothes, you’re all hooked on TV phones, you’re all yammering nonstop about “SPACs,” the Cal-Berkeley quarterback wants to host “Jeopardy!”, there are two more Harry Potter books, they still haven’t finished LaGuardia Airport, the Cubs won a World Series,  Amazon ’s  trying to build a hotel on the moon, a Shiba Inu controls the economy, and the New York Knicks are actually good.<br />What the hell is going on?<br />I’m not mad. I’m just a little disoriented. More than a decade and a half underground can do that. It’s like the worst vodka Red Bull hangover anyone’s ever had. Is everyone still ordering vodka Red Bulls? I hope not.<br />I know, I know: There are reports out there that a fungus is causing male cicadas to lose parts of themselves and grow exceptionally…amorous."
