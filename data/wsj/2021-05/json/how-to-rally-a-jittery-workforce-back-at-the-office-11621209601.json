    "body": "Graham Chapman’s team is getting back to work. But things are weird.<br />People don’t chat like they used to, he’s noticed. Through the glass wall of his office, the manager of 15 can see workers’ shoulders tensing up. When he walks the halls he hears them sighing.<br />He’d hoped a recent all-company lunch would provide a kumbaya moment, but instead staff split into awkward cliques inside and outside, depending on their level of Covid caution. Some immediately fled to their desks, plates of Greek food in hand, to keep plugging away on work.<br />“I was just hoping that it was back to normal,” says Mr. Chapman, a vice president of account services at 919 Marketing, a marketing agency in Holly Springs, N.C. “It was not normal. It was bizarre.”<br />We’re trickling back to the office in a changed world, and as changed humans. Many of us are still burned out and grieving after a year that pushed us to our limits. Workspaces feel different and eerie—rearranged to accommodate social distancing and hybrid schedules, or dotted with empty desks after rounds of layoffs."
