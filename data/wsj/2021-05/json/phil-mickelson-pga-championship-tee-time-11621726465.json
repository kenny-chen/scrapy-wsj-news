    "body": "The last time Phil Mickelson looked like a dominant golfer was in 2020. That’s when he made his debut on the PGA Tour’s senior circuit. He had just turned 50 years old, making him eligible to wallop a bunch of golfers even older than him. He was the TikTok generation of the PGA Tour Champions.<br />He won each of his first two events against his 50-and-older competitors. He was still good enough to play fantastic golf, but he no longer looked good enough to beat the golfers half his age. He won just twice on the PGA Tour ever since his 2013 win at the British Open.<br />Yet this weekend Phil Mickelson is 18 holes away from winning another major title–not on the senior circuit—and making history.<br />Mickelson finished the third round at this PGA Championship at Kiawah Island Golf Resort’s Ocean Course at 7-under-par, placing him one shot ahead of fellow American Brooks Koepka, who has taken home four majors since Mickelson last won one. A win would make Mickelson the oldest major champion ever, surpassing Julius Boros, who won the 1968 PGA Championship at 48, and give Mickelson six major titles.<br />“Physically I feel like I’m able to perform and hit the shots that I’ve hit throughout my career, and I feel like I can do it every bit as well as I have,” he said Friday. “But I’ve got to have that clear picture and focus.”"
