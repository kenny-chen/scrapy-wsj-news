    "body": "<br /><br />In the years immediately after World War II, American moviegoers were ready for something new. They’d had their fill of patriotic war pictures and, before that, light comedies and moralistic melodramas. Now a more somber mood settled in, and with it films that explored life’s less salubrious aspects. Not all these films proved successful at the box office, but many have attained classic status just the same, widely embraced by latter-day critics and adventuresome film fans.<br />Among the most esteemed, despite its initial commercial failure, is “Nightmare Alley” (1947), based on a bestselling novel of the same name by William Lindsay Gresham, published the previous year. The picture was produced and released by 20th Century Fox but did not enjoy the patronage of studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck, whose support would likely have helped the film. Instead, the production’s driving force was Tyrone Power, the matinee idol who was the studio’s premier leading man from the late 1930s through the 1940s.<br />The film made it to home video in 2005 in a reasonably good transfer from Fox but has been hard to come by for some time, so cineastes should thrill to its arrival on Blu-ray (and DVD) in a splendid, if occasionally overbright, 4K restoration from the Criterion Collection."
