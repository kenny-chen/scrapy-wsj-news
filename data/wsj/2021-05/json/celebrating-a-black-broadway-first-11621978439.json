    "body": "<br /><br /><br />One hundred years ago this month, a Broadway musical opened that defied all expectations and broke down barriers for African-American performing artists. “Shuffle Along” became one of the first successful shows written, staged and performed by Black people, and the first to make Black dance an integral part of the production.<br />The musical combined the talents of the vaudeville team of Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles, who contributed comedic routines about two politicians in a fictional Southern town, with the lyrics of Noble Sissle and the music of Eubie Blake—the most consequential of the four, who had begun his career as a ragtime pianist."
