    "body": "Apollo  Global Management Inc. reported a first-quarter profit Tuesday as the value of its investments soared.<br />The New York firm posted net income of $678.9 million, or $2.81 a share. That compares with a loss of $996.2 million, or $4.47 a share, a year earlier when the coronavirus-fueled market downturn hit the value of its investments.<br />Apollo’s private-equity portfolio appreciated 22% during the quarter, beating out rivals and easily topping the S&P 500, which climbed 5.8% during the period. The gains were broad-based and came as the firm’s value-oriented investment strategy began to pay off.<br />In the latest example of that strategy, which often involves polishing up underperforming assets and accelerating their growth, the firm announced a deal Monday to buy Yahoo and AOL from  Verizon Communications Inc.  for $5 billion.<br />Apollo also posted record fee-related earnings of $286.7 million in the first quarter, up 26% from a year earlier."
