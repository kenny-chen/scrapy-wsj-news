Exxon’s shares rose 1.2% Wednesday.<br />Amazon . com Inc.<br />A titan of the tech world wants to direct one of Hollywood’s most fabled studios.

A MGM purchase would mark Amazon’s second-largest acquisition in history, behind its $13.7 billion pickup of Whole Foods in 2017, and highlights the premium that content is commanding as streaming wars force consolidation. Amazon’s shares rose 0.2% Wednesday.<br />Bank of America"
