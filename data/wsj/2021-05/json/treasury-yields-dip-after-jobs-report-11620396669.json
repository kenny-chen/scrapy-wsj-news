    "body": "U.S. government bond yields swung sharply Friday after a disappointing jobs report caught traders off guard but didn’t fundamentally change Wall Street’s mostly optimistic outlook on the economic recovery.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell as low as 1.487%, according to Tradeweb, compared with roughly 1.570% just before the report was released and 1.561% Thursday. But it quickly rebounded and ultimately settled at 1.576%.<br />Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, initially slid after the Labor Department said the economy added 266,000 jobs in April, well short of the one million new jobs that economists had anticipated and down from 770,000 jobs added in March.<br />The “report was pretty uniformly disappointing,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. Still, it was “not all that surprising given the fact that economic data in the middle of a pandemic is always difficult to estimate,” he said.<br />After starting the year below 1%, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.75% in March, as investors bet that vaccine and government-spending fueled economic rebound would spur inflation above the Federal Reserve’s 2% annual target. Yields have since subsided as investors take a more wait-and-see approach to the recovery."
