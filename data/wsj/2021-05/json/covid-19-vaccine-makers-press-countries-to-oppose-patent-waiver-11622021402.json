    "body": "Covid-19 vaccine makers have dialed up lobbying and public-relations efforts to rally opposition to a proposal to temporarily waive their patents.<br />Since the Biden administration threw its support behind the waiver proposal early this month, pharmaceutical industry trade groups have been moving to support Germany, Japan and other countries that expressed opposition, people familiar with the lobbying said. The industry lobbyists have told the governments, in meetings and phone calls, that a waiver wouldnâ€™t address shortages any time soon, while straining raw material supplies, the people said.<br />Vaccine makers have also rolled out pledges to deliver more doses to developing countries, which have pressed for the waiver.<br />Industry lobbyists have met with Biden administration officials to argue for alternative actions, the people said. And the industry representatives have been lobbying members of Congress to pressure the Biden administration to reverse its support of the waiver, according to the people and a lobbyist email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The World Trade Organization has the authority to grant drug-patent waivers, if all 164 member countries agree, and the organization is scheduled to hold a ministerial conference starting in November."
