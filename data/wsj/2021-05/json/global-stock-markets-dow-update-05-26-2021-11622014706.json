    "body": "U.S. stock futures rose as investors grew more comfortable that the Federal Reserve and other central banks would maintain their economic support despite a near-term bout of inflation.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 added 0.3%, indicating that the broad market index could post gains after declining Tuesday. Nasdaq-100 futures also rose 0.3%, suggesting advancement for technology stocks after the New York opening bell.<br />Dow futures were up 0.2%. Wednesday is the 125th anniversary of the launch of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.<br />Investors had worried that higher inflation would cause Fed officials to dial back the monetary policy that pulled markets back from the Covid-19 selloff last year. While officials in recent days have indicated they may begin discussing scaling back measures, they have stressed that there are no imminent plans to change policy.<br />“All these signals from the Federal Reserve are that there’s no rush to turn off liquidity,” said Savvas Savouri, chief economist at Toscafund Asset Management."
