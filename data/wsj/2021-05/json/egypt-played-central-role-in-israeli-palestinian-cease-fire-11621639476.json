The State Department also announced that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to the region.<br />Officials in Washington and Cairo had been in constant contact over the past week in the hope that Egypt might exert its influence with Hamas’s leadership to bring an end to the conflict, Western and Egyptian officials said.<br />Egypt’s intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, and its foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, began their mediation efforts with the Palestinian militant group in the opening days of the conflict and communicated a message from the U.S. that it wanted an immediate halt to rocket fire, according to officials familiar with the talks."
