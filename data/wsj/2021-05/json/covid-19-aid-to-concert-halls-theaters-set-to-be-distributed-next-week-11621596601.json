    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Small Business Administration is aiming to start awarding Covid-19 aid to concert halls, theaters and other live-entertainment venues early next week, according to agency administrator Isabel Guzman.<br />Congress created the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program, designed to deliver coronavirus aid in the form of $16 billion in grants to the performance-venues industry, in December. The agency has taken months to distribute the funds as it built the program from scratch and dealt with technological challenges. The program, part of a $900 billion rescue package, aims to provide grants of up to $10 million per business.<br />The SBA is currently reviewing submitted applications for the program, Ms. Guzman said Thursday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. More than 12,000 applications have been submitted since the program opened April 26, according to SBA data released this week.<br />Agency press officers previously said the SBA was aiming to begin grant awards this week. The long wait for aid has become a sore point for the industry.<br />“These small businesses are going under while $16 billion is waiting for them,” said Audrey Fix Schaefer, a spokeswoman for the National Independent Venue Association, which lobbied Congress for the grant program. “The delay in delivering funding is causing the exact opposite effect of the intended bill to save venues.”"
