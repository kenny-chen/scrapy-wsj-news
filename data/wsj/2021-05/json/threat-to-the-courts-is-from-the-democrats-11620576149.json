    "body": "Regarding David B. Rivkin Jr. and Andrew M. Grossman’s “Sheldon Whitehouse Is No Friend of the Courts” (op-ed, April 30): Never one for subtlety, Sen. Whitehouse, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Federal Courts, held a recent hearing titled “What’s Wrong with the Supreme Court: The Big-Money Assault on Our Judiciary.” While dark money may bankroll briefs from amici who generally have little sway with the court, the briefs from members of Congress trying to intimidate the court are much more problematic. After all, the justices aren’t blind to the fact that Congress has the power to pack the court, impeach justices, slash the judiciary’s budget and even restrict the court’s jurisdiction in accordance with Article III of the Constitution.<br />A certain senator from Rhode Island is known for his threatening briefs. Of course, he and his fellow Senate Democrats have also made Supreme Court nomination hearings a national disgrace. They’re the ones assaulting our judiciary, a co-equal branch of government.<br />Charles D. Eden<br />Atlanta"
