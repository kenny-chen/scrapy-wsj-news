    "body": "Salesforce.com Inc.  Chief Executive Marc Benioff and other big investors are beefing up their stakes in a firm that matches companies wanting to offset emissions with timber owners willing to defer harvests for a fee.<br />The firm, SilviaTerra, will change its name to NCX, after its Natural Capital Exchange carbon market, and add Mr. Benioff to its board as part of a $20-million funding pact led by the software executive. Other investors include Union Square Ventures, Version One Ventures and  Microsoft Corp.’s  Climate Innovation Fund.<br />The deal is the latest in the booming business of paying forest owners not to cut down trees but instead lease standing timber as carbon sponges to companies that aim to eventually operate without adding carbon to the atmosphere. Last year oil giant  BP  PLC bought a controlling stake in Finite Carbon, an NCX rival.<br />“This isn’t philanthropy,” Mr. Benioff said in an interview. “This is an actual use of capitalism to create greater sustainability.”<br />Mr. Benioff said his personal venture firm has done well wagering about $1 billion on technology companies, but that it recently decided to invest aggressively in sustainability businesses. NCX is his firm’s first such wager, he said, on the belief that big companies will face increasing pressure from investors, customers and regulators to offset emissions that they cannot eliminate."
