    "body": "New York politicians are preparing for a contentious redistricting process after the U.S. Census Bureau said last week that the state’s delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives will decrease by a seat.<br />The once-in-a-decade act of drawing new lines for the state Senate, Assembly and Congress is in the hands of a new bipartisan commission. It was created in 2014 to try wringing some of the politics out of a famously political process.<br />This is also the first time in 50 years that redistricting will unfold with one party—Democrats—in full control of New York’s government. That could lead to district lines that advantage that party, observers said, as part of a process that will unfold over the next year.<br />“It can become a knock-down, drag-out,” said Keith L.T. Wright, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Manhattan who served more than two decades in the state Assembly, referring to redistricting.<br />Lines for the House of Representatives could present the biggest challenge, observers said. The Census Bureau allocates seats in the 435-member House among states based on their relative populations. On Monday, Census officials announced that New York’s delegation would shrink to 26 from 27."
