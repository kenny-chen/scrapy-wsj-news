    "body": "Cinemark Holdings Inc.  struck agreements to show films from some of its major Hollywood studio partners, a move aimed at establishing how long movies play in theaters before moving to home video.<br />The movie-theater company on Friday said the deals—with Warner Bros. Pictures Group,  Walt Disney Co. , Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment—build on a November pact with Universal Filmed Entertainment Group.<br />Cinemark didn’t disclose terms of the deals. “Some go for multiple months; some go for multiple years,” Chief Executive Mark Zoradi said on a call with analysts.<br />Under Cinemark’s deal with Universal, movies that gross more than $50 million domestically during their first weekend in theaters will continue to be shown in theaters exclusively for five weekends, or 31 days. After that, while theaters can continue to screen a film, the title would be available concurrently on premium online rental platforms like Apple TV and  Amazon  Prime Video.<br />“In our ongoing efforts to maximize attendance and box-office during the pandemic and beyond, our goal is to provide the widest range of content with terms that are in the best long-term interests of Cinemark, our studio partners and moviegoers,” Mr. Zoradi said."
