    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Ben Schneider, leader of the folk-rock group Lord Huron, creates fantasy spaces with his work that exist outside of time. It’s as if a kitschy painting of a scrubby desert scene from the Old West hanging on the wall in a junk shop suddenly came to life, and his songs are an invitation to experience what’s going on there.<br />Mr. Schneider, who lives in Los Angeles and grew up in Michigan a couple of hours’ drive from the lake that inspired his band’s name, studied art in college and worked for a time as a graphic designer and a creative director. His music—beginning with two EPs he recorded alone in 2010 and followed by a debut LP with a full band, “Lonesome Dreams,” in 2012—has a decidedly cinematic flair, heavy on mood and evocative imagery. Lord Huron brings to mind the high-lonesome sound of antecedents like the Band, Neil Young and later harmony-drenched outfits including My Morning Jacket and Fleet Foxes."
