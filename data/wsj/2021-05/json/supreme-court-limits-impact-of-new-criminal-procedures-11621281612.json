    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court scaled back protections for criminal defendants, holding that decisions establishing new procedural rules, no matter how significant, may never provide relief for inmates whose direct appeals have concluded.<br />Monday’s 6-3 decision, along conservative-liberal lines, came in a case over the court’s 2020 ruling that juries must be unanimous to convict for serious crimes; that decision, by a different lineup of justices, overturned laws in Louisiana and Oregon that had allowed guilty verdicts by 10-2 or 11-1 votes.<br />The court’s opinion, by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, said the 2020 case, Ramos v. Louisiana, didn’t meet the criteria for retroactivity the court established 32 years ago. It went on to invalidate those criteria altogether, declaring that going forward, no new criminal procedure rules could benefit defendants during habeas corpus proceedings, which generally are filed after direct appeals to contest the legality of a conviction.<br />The decision effectively completes the process begun in 1989, when in Teague v. Lane the court plurality said that only “watershed rules of criminal procedure” essential for “fundamental fairness” should be applied retroactively, something it predicted would be rare.<br />Justice Kavanaugh wrote that rather than rare, the intervening years had proven such circumstances nonexistent."
