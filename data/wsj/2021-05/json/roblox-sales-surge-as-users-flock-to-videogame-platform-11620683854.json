    "body": "Roblox Corp.’s  first-quarter revenue more than doubled as the videogame company continued to benefit from pandemic-fueled demand for at-home social entertainment.<br />The growth came as more users spent more money on Roblox, primarily in the form of virtual currency, called Robux, used to buy in-game items like pets and costumes for players’ avatars.<br />Still, the company posted a nearly 82% wider loss in the period, its first quarterly report since it started trading publicly in March, on higher costs to support its growth and expenses tied to its direct listing.<br />Roblox said Monday that the results reflect strong engagement among users, most of whom are under the age of 13. The company didn’t issue a new outlook for the current quarter, but has previously warned that growth is likely to slow as social-distancing guidelines ease. It is working to attract users of older demographics and expand geographically in regions such as Western Europe and East Asia.<br />Roblox is attracting more users to its platform, with the number of average daily users at 42.1 million in the quarter, up 79% from last year, driven by growth outside of its core market of the U.S. and Canada. Average bookings per daily user, which represents the amount of Robux purchased, rose 46% to $15.48."
