    "body": "T-Mobile  US Inc. said in 2019 that its merger with wireless rival Sprint Corp. would be “jobs-positive from Day One.”<br />More than a year into that marriage, the combined company has fewer people working for it than before.<br />T-Mobile’s big spending on next-generation wireless technology has yet to show up in its head count, which dropped over the past year despite thousands of new job openings. The cellphone carrier reported 75,000 full-time and part-time equivalent workers at the end of last year, roughly 5,000 fewer than it had when it closed its merger with Sprint.<br />Chief Executive Mike Sievert said the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with a faster-than-expected combination with its erstwhile rival, restrained its head count. But he said the company has 6,000 open positions it expects to fill as the economy rebounds.<br />“We’ve moved from a phase in 2020 where we were focused on combining the two companies, and that causes us to look for some efficiencies, to where the results of those efficiencies turn out to be growth,” Mr. Sievert said in an interview. “Now we’re hiring and hiring as rapidly as we can.”"
