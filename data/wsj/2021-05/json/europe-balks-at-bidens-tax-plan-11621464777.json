    "body": "The Biden Administration hopes a new global minimum corporate tax will dampen the blow of its tax increases on the U.S. economy. But other governments are making it clearer by the day that they won’t play along.<br />Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has thrown herself enthusiastically into negotiations at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to write such a global tax regime. President Biden wants to impose a form of alternative minimum tax on corporate profits earned overseas, with a statutory rate of 21% and an effective rate that’s higher for many companies. Even the progressives manning the Biden barricades realize this will throttle U.S. competitiveness if other countries don’t impose similar taxes.<br />Ms. Yellen might have thought long-running OECD negotiations toward a global minimum tax would be an easy way to achieve this goal. Instead, European governments are adopting a version of Napoleon’s maxim: Never interrupt Washington while it’s harming itself.<br />One problem is the rate the OECD will propose for its own version of a minimum tax. The talks seem most likely to settle near 12%-13%, close to Ireland’s current corporate tax rate. That’s far below the rate Mr. Biden wants to apply to American companies, and European governments are aware of the competitive benefits of lower rates.<br />Officials in Ireland, Hungary and the Czech Republic—all of whom will have to agree to an OECD proposal before the European Union can adopt it—have said recently an OECD rate of 21% would be unacceptably high."
