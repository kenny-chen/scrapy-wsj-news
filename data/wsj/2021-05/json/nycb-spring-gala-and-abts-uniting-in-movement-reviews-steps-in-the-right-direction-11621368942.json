    "body": "<br /><br /><br />New York City Ballet’s current digital season, through June 17, offers a changing array of archived and new dances as well as various talking-head and interactive programs. A special offering is this year’s spring gala—particularly the May 5 world premiere of “Solo” by NYCB resident choreographer and artistic adviser Justin Peck, set to a quartet arrangement of Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for Strings.” Performed in the theater’s upstairs promenade and on the stage of the David H. Koch Theater of Lincoln Center, the gala was filmed with authority and visual beauty by Sofia Coppola and remains available through May 27 at nycballet.com/digitalseason.<br />“Solo” climaxes the handsome black-and-white opening portion, before the 30-minute film moves to color for the finale of George Balanchine’s “Divertimento No. 15,” to Mozart. Mr. Peck’s compellingly evolving choreography, variously contemplative and urgent, winningly showcases boyish NYCB principal dancer Anthony Huxley, whose dancing takes him winding and unwinding through classical and sometimes casual-seeming moves that resonate poetically on the vastness of the empty stage."
