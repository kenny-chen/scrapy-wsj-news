    "body": "When the secretive military chief of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas emerged from the shadows last week, he chose to weigh in on a land dispute in East Jerusalem, threatening to retaliate against Israel if Palestinian residents there were evicted from their homes.<br />“If the aggression against our people…doesn’t stop immediately,” warned the commander, Mohammad Deif, “the enemy will pay an expensive price.”<br />Hamas followed through on the threat, firing from the Gaza Strip, which it governs, over a thousand rockets at Israel since Monday evening. The barrage and the Israeli counterstrikes targeting Hamas positions in Gaza have set the two sides on a course for another conflict and escalated tensions across Israel and the Palestinian territories.<br />Hamas’s show of force is one way the militant group is trying to win over young and frustrated Palestinians like those who have led the protests over the evictions, but have been losing faith in their aging leaders and relinquishing hopes for an independent Palestinian state.<br />“I think Hamas right now is promoting a very calculated and very planned crisis,” said Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at the Moshe Dayan Center of Tel Aviv University."
