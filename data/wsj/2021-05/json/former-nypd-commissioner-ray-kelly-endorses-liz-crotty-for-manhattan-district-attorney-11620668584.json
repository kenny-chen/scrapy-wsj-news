    "body": "Liz Crotty is cementing a position as the most traditional, law-and-order candidate for Manhattan district attorney in a group of more progressive contenders, with former New York City Police Department commissioner Raymond Kelly endorsing her campaign Monday.<br />Mr. Kelly’s endorsement added to a growing support for Ms. Crotty from current and former police officers, including four unions representing the New York Police Department sergeants, lieutenants, captains and detectives. Mr. Kelly’s backing came two days after a 4-year-old girl in a stroller and two women were shot in Times Square, adding to concern about gun violence and crime in the city.<br />“Liz Crotty is the whole package, someone who knows the courtroom from both sides as a prosecutor and a defense attorney, and knows that police officers are an irreplaceable partner in keeping the city safe,” said Mr. Kelly, who worked as commissioner under two mayors, David Dinkins, a Democrat, and Michael Bloomberg, who ran as both a Republican and independent.<br />Ms. Crotty is among eight candidates running in the June 22 Democratic primary to replace Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., a three-term Democrat who announced this year he wouldn’t seek re-election. The winner is likely to be the next district attorney in a borough where Democrats widely outnumber Republicans.<br />Ms. Crotty is a former Manhattan prosecutor who has worked as a criminal- defense attorney for more than a decade. She presents herself as a centrist, “safety first” candidate in contrast with her opponents who have campaigned on plans to jail fewer people and end racial disparities in the justice system. Ms. Crotty said she was the only candidate who hadn’t released a list of crimes she won’t prosecute and was more concerned with being a fair prosecutor than a progressive one."
