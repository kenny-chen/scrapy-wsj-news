    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged down Monday, signaling muted losses for major indexes at the opening bell following a week in which concerns about inflation whipsawed markets.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked down 0.3%. The broad market gauge retreated over 1.3% last week. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% Monday. Futures on the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 also edged 0.4% lower.<br />With earnings season drawing to a close, investors remain focused on whether a recent jump in inflation will blow over or become entrenched. A protracted spell of faster growth in consumer prices could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, potentially hurting stocks and other assets that have gained from low interest rates.<br />Those concerns last week led the S&P 500 to post its biggest decline since late February, even after staging a rebound on Friday. Highflying tech stocks have been particularly vulnerable to worries about inflation: The Nasdaq Composite has fallen for four straight weeks, its longest losing streak since August 2019.<br />“We see this as transitory, but you never know: there is stuff in here that could take a bit longer,” said Lars Skovgaard Andersen, investment strategist at Danske Bank Wealth Management. “There will be some volatility in markets still.”"
