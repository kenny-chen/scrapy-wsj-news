    "body": "Young families led an exodus out of New York City during the pandemic. College students and recent graduates are leading a return.<br />Waves of undergraduates and grad students at Columbia University, New York University and the city’s dozens of other colleges are returning in the fall, often for the first time since early 2020 and searching for a place to live. Many are signing new leases earlier in the year than usual, resuming their pre-pandemic lives and looking to enjoy a summer in the city after losing that experience last year.<br />Young professionals are also streaming back ahead of office reopenings toward the end of summer, while New Yorkers working in creative industries are returning for theater auditions and musical performances.<br />That includes Madison Claire Parks, a 25-year-old singer and actress who recently returned from her pandemic retreat in Los Angeles. She signed a lease this April for a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side, an upgrade from her previous studio.<br />“It’s cheaper, too,” she said. “I definitely see myself in New York for the next five to 10 years.”"
