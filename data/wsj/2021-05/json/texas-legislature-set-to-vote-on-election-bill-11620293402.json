    "body": "AUSTIN, Texasâ€”Lawmakers in Texas approved Republican-sponsored election legislation early Friday, after an all-night debate.<br />Republicans characterized the bill, which would increase penalties for some voting irregularities, as a way to protect against voter fraud. Democrats said it would disenfranchise voters. It passed in an 81-64 party-line vote at 3 a.m.<br />The bill was a top priority of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in the biennial session. It received pushback from civil-rights groups and corporations. The White House criticized a Florida election law after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it Thursday and several groups filed at least two lawsuits in federal court, arguing the law would impede voter access to the ballot box.<br />The Texas bill and Florida law followed a Georgia law, passed in March, that included new identification requirements for mail-in voters and set limits on drop boxes.<br />The Texas bill would reduce flexibility within the election code and make its penalties more severe. It would bar public officials from distributing applications for mail-in ballots and empower partisan poll watchers. The state Senate previously approved a different version of the bill that limits early election hours, prohibits drive-through voting and allows poll watchers to photograph people voting. Those measures could be reinstated."
