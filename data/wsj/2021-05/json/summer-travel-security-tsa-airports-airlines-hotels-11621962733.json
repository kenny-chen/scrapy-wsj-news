The travel ecosphere isn’t ready for big crowds, even though they’re coming.<br />As Memorial Day nears, it’s clear that while travelers are ready to go, travel companies and key agencies like TSA are playing catch-up. Rental cars won’t be the only thing hard to find: wheelchair pushers, security screeners and other airport and hotel staff are in short supply.<br />Many airport restaurants will remain closed until at least midsummer. Hotels will keep lots of Covid cutbacks in place, from closed lounges to no water glass in the bathroom.<br />Airlines say phone call volume is up, and so is wait time. It’s a triple whammy: Some customers call trying to redeem vouchers and flight credits given out for pandemic-canceled flights, others with questions about masks, required Covid-19 tests and border restrictions. And reservation centers are understaffed for the volume because of workforce reductions. Airlines are scrambling to hire.<br />“There’s been an added level of complexity.
