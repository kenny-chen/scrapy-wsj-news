    "body": "Celebrity-backed Swedish oat-milk maker Oatly Group AB prepared to price its initial public offering Wednesday amid another day of stock-market declines.<br />The company set its sights on raising between $1.27 billion and $1.43 billion by selling roughly 84.4 million shares at a price of $15 to $17 a share, according to a regulatory filing. At the midpoint, Oatly would fetch a valuation of roughly $10 billion.<br />Oatly’s stock is expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market Thursday under the symbol OTLY. Proceeds from the IPO will go to both the company and selling shareholders.<br />Going public has proved tough for several companies recently, as the stock market has taken a turn lower on fears of inflation and investors have increasingly shied away from the types of growth companies that typically go public.<br />Last week, at least three companies postponed their IPOs due to volatility in the stock market. On Wednesday, website-development company  Squarespace Inc.’s  shares debuted on the New York Stock Exchange at a level far below their last financing round, then proceeded to fall further through the afternoon."
