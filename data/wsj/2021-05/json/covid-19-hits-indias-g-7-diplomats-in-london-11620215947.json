British rules state they must isolate for 10 days. The other delegations aren’t expected to be affected, he added.<br />Britain had touted the first foreign ministers meeting in two years as an opportunity to revitalize in-person diplomacy and a test run for a gathering of G-7 leaders next month. The delegation from India, a country that is being ravaged by a wave of Covid-19 infections, was one of several invited to attend from outside the G-7, including Australia, South Korea and South Africa.<br />All participants were tested daily for the virus. Although members met indoors they were masked at all times. Foreign ministers were photographed fist bumping when they gathered earlier this week."
