    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate appeared poised Thursday to pass legislation aimed at helping the U.S. maintain its lead in technology amid rising competition from China and other nations.<br />The Senate bill—which has emerged as one of the few big bipartisan legislative efforts so far this year—began moving toward final passage after a 68-30 vote to proceed Thursday afternoon.<br />A final vote appeared likely Thursday night, although timing remained uncertain. The legislation also faces challenges reaching a final deal with the House.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who has led the charge for the Innovation and Competition Act, said it would help the U.S. halt a gradual decline as the world’s leader in scientific research and innovation “and lay the foundation, instead, for another American century.”<br />“That’s why this is a moment in history that future generations could well look back on as a turning point for American leadership in the 21st century,” he said."
