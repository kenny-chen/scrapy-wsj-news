    "body": "PORTO, Portugal—Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel was too busy twisting himself into knots on the sideline to truly contemplate how absurd the past six months of his life had been.<br />The German beanpole paced back and forth, living every pass his players made, flailing his limbs and shouting in multiple languages. But for him to even be in this position—coaching in his second Champions League final in two seasons—Tuchel first had to get fired last Christmas Eve.<br />The man who began the season in charge of Paris Saint-Germain was turfed out of the club last December, only for European soccer’s coaching merry-go-round to spin him to London a month later. What came next was a stunning transformation that saw him turn the underperforming club into one of soccer’s most sophisticated teams.<br />And in front of 16,000 fans on Saturday night in Porto, Chelsea made the point emphatically by upsetting Manchester City 1-0 to win the Champions League for the second time in its history. Tuchel, who lost in the final with PSG last season, had gone from unemployed on Christmas to European champion.<br />The difference came in the 42nd minute when Chelsea’s homegrown midfielder Mason Mount sliced open the middle of City’s defense with a pass to find Kai Havertz, who carried the ball around the goalkeeper and passed it into an empty net."
