    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden faces a significant political and foreign-policy challenge as fighting intensifies between Israel and Hamas and as Democrats have become more divided on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br />As the violence nears the end of its first week, the president has sought to defuse tensions while avoiding taking sides in the conflict that has drawn criticism from many in his party. Republicans have pressed him to take a more firm stance in defense of Israel.<br />The White House on Friday said it was engaged extensively in behind-the-scenes discussions with Israelis, Palestinians and other key players in the region, following the Israeli military launching the most intense bombardment of its five-day military operation in the Gaza Strip, adding tank and artillery fire from the ground to its campaign of airstrikes.<br />In a statement on the White House’s Eid celebration, Mr. Biden said Friday both Palestinians—including in Gaza—and Israelis “equally deserve to live in dignity, safety and security.”<br />“No family should have to fear for their safety within their own home or place of worship,” he said."
