    "body": "Jo Craven McGinty’s column “The Numbers: This Plastic Recyclable? Depends on the Sort?” (U.S. News, April 24) could have been called “Here’s Why Recycling Doesn’t Work.” Despite the plastics industry’s convincing consumers for decades that plastic pollution would disappear if they just recycled more effectively, the truth is in the numbers. Only 9% of plastic waste is ever recycled, and much of our plastic isn’t recyclable anyway.<br />The distraction worked though. While we fretted about recycling, industry exponentially increased the amount of plastic it produced. It is time to hold producers accountable. Companies must ditch the plastic and invest in sustainable alternatives such as reusable and refillable products and packaging. We lived without unnecessary plastic once and can do it again. Just as previous generations purchased milk in containers that were returned and reused, we can adopt systems of reuse—but with the convenience that today’s technology offers. Federal lawmakers have already outlined a plan to get us there. The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, introduced in Congress earlier this year, would ban certain single-use plastics and make producers responsible for their pollution.<br />Christy Leavitt<br />Oceana<br />Washington"
