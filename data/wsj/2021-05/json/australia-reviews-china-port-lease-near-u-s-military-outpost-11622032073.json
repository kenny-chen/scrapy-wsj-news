    "body": "A Chinese deal to manage an Australian port near where thousands of U.S. and local troops train has become the latest fault line in a worsening diplomatic and trade relationship between Canberra and Beijing.<br />Australian defense officials are reviewing whether a 99-year lease granted to Shandong Landbridge Group in 2015 to operate Darwin Port—in exchange for 506 million Australian dollars, or about $392 million—is a potential national security threat.<br />The deal blindsided the U.S. government at the time, as it wasn’t told in advance about the lease of the port by the Northern Territory government to Landbridge.<br />The port handles ammunition, equipment and fuel used by U.S. marines and the Australian troops who train with them for up to six months of the year, defense experts say. It is also the most suitable site in northern Australia for a major naval base and provides the country’s closest route to disputed South China Sea waters.<br />Darwin Port routinely supports exercises of the Australian defense forces and hosts visits by Australian and foreign navies, according to the port’s annual reports."
