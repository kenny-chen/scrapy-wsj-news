The Ireland-based airline’s chief executive called the diversion “a case of state-sponsored hijacking.”<br />Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko scrambled a jet fighter Sunday to force a Ryanair commercial aircraft to land in Minsk, where a journalist and opposition activist was detained. The incident sparked an international outcry and raised questions over the legality of the plane’s grounding.<br />The aircraft was flying from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, when it was diverted to land in the Belarusian capital."
