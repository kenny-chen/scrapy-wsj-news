    "body": "Editor’s note: This week’s Future View discusses U.S. policy toward Israel and Hamas. Next week we’ll focus on student loans. The White House budget plan reportedly won’t include student debt relief, a Biden campaign promise. Should it be more of a priority, or should the president drop his promise altogether? Students can click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before June 1. The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Behind the Anti-Israel Animus<br />Opponents of Israel believe the fundamental issue behind the fighting in Gaza is Western imperialism. They identify the Palestinians as the oppressed and Israel as the oppressor. Once this narrative locks in, the facts become secondary. Every step Israel takes to defend its citizens becomes cruel, evil, monstrous.<br />Israel is the freest, most tolerant and most prosperous nation in the Middle East—and its opponents won’t forgive it for that. Israel’s success, so incongruous in the Middle East, must have been achieved through oppression and intolerance, the opponents argue. But in a region that alternates between despotism, Islamism and anarchy, Israel succeeds because it upholds Western values. Jews and Arabs have equal rights and elect their leaders. Could Jews expect the same under Palestinian rule? They can’t in any other Arab state, and the Palestinians demand the expulsion of all Jews from the areas they want to control."
