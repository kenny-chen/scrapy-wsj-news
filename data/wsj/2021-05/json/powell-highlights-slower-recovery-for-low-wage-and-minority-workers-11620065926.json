    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said rules on lending in low-income communities should be extended to cover all firms providing consumer credit, not just banks.<br />“Like activities should have like regulation,” Mr. Powell said, speaking to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a fair-lending advocacy group.<br />The remarks signaled Mr. Powell’s support for efforts to overhaul a more-than-40-year-old law called the Community Reinvestment Act to encompass non-banks that increasingly provide the bulk of credit to individual borrowers, particularly in the $11 trillion mortgage market.<br />President Biden said on the campaign trail last year that he would push to expand the law to cover nonbank mortgage and insurance companies, which would require legislation.<br />The 1977 law requires banks to serve borrowers of all income levels around their branches or face growth restrictions. It was initially created to address the practice of redlining—or banks failing to serve poor and minority neighborhoods."
