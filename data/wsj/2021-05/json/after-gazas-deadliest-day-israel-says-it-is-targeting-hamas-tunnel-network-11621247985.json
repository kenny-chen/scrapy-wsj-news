    "body": "TEL AVIV—Israel launched more airstrikes early Monday in the Gaza Strip targeting what its military said was a tunnel network used by Hamas, as it tries to blunt the militant group’s ability to attack Israeli territory.<br />The Israeli military said a 20-minute overnight assault with 54 warplanes hit roughly 9 miles of underground passageways it says are used to ferry weapons and fighters across Gaza. Israel has dubbed the subterranean network Hamas’s “metro.”<br />Yahya al-Sarraj, the mayor of Gaza City, the strip’s biggest population center, said the strikes hadn’t targeted military positions and instead hit roads and civil infrastructure, setting the economy back years. He called the strikes collective punishment and asked the international community to stop assaults on vital infrastructure in Gaza.<br />Hamas also fired scores more rockets toward Israel overnight and Monday, without causing injuries, the Israeli military said.<br />In total, 197 people, including 58 children and 34 women, have been killed in Gaza since last Monday, according to the Palestinian health ministry. In Israel, 11 people, including one child, have been killed, according to Israel’s emergency response service and military."
