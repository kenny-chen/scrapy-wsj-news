    "body": "TORONTO—Canada is fighting to stop U.S. officials from closing a vital cross-border oil and gas pipeline as a deadline to shut it looms.<br />The dispute erupted in November, when Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced she was revoking a permit that allows  Enbridge Inc.’s  Line 5 pipeline to run along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. She gave the company until May 12 to shut the pipeline.<br />The 645-mile conduit carries more than a half million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids each day from Superior, Wis., to refineries in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario and Quebec.<br />Canadian officials and Enbridge say closing the pipeline would choke off almost half of the supply used to make gasoline, jet fuel and home-heating oil for Ontario and Quebec, the most populous parts of the country. The closure could lead to higher fuel costs and thousands of job losses in the refineries that process the oil, officials say.<br />Enbridge has sued Michigan in federal court to stop the revocation, arguing the state has no authority to do so, and said it won’t shut the pipeline down unless ordered by a court."
