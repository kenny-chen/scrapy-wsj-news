    "body": "Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, announced Tuesday that he would seek the Republican nomination for governor of New York next year.<br />Mr. Giuliani, 35 years old, recently worked as a White House aide during the Trump administration. He said he was campaigning on a platform of economic development, increasing the number of charter schools in the state and bolstering public safety.<br />“Whoever is going to be the next successful governor of New York is going to be using the Giuliani playbook on crime reduction,” he said, referring to his father’s tenure as mayor from 1994 to 2002. “I think I know a few things about that.”<br />Two candidates are already seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination: U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, of Suffolk County; and former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, the Republican standard-bearer in 2014.<br />The multicandidate primary is in contrast to 2018, when party leaders scrambled to find a candidate to challenge Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who was elected to a third term that year."
