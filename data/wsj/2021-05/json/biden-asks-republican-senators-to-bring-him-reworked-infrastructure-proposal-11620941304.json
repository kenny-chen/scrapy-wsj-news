    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden asked a group of Republican senators to flesh out their $568 billion infrastructure proposal with additional details, including how they would pay for it, a step that could begin more substantive negotiations on the issue.<br />Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), a lead negotiator for the GOP on the package, said Thursday after an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Biden and five other Republican senators that the president “asked us to come back and rework an offer so he can then react to that and re-offer to us. So we’re very encouraged.”<br />Mr. Biden said after the meeting that he was optimistic the group could reach a reasonable agreement and planned to discuss a more detailed offer from the Republican senators next week. The group had previously released a two-page plan that called for unspecified user fees to cover its cost.<br />Mr. Biden has said he is open to a compromise on his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal, which calls for new spending on roads, bridges, broadband, and boosting electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing. He has held meetings this week with congressional leaders and centrist Democratic senators.<br />Republicans have said they could support a narrower plan in the range of $600 to $800 billion but have rejected the president’s proposal to pay for it by raising taxes on companies."
