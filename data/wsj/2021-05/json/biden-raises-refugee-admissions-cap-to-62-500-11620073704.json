    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden is raising the refugee admissions cap to 62,500 for the rest of this fiscal year, after facing blowback for backing away from that number amid a surge of migrants crossing the southern border illegally.<br />“It is important to take this action today to remove any lingering doubt in the minds of refugees around the world who have suffered so much, and who are anxiously waiting for their new lives to begin,” Mr. Biden said.<br />The move comes less than a month after Mr. Biden signed an executive order saying that he would keep the admissions ceiling at a record low 15,000 set by the Trump administration, sparking a political backlash from progressives, immigration advocates and religious leaders.<br />The April order eliminated restrictions the Trump administration had put in place concerning which types of refugees qualify to be resettled, but left the number unchanged. That decision surprised advocates, after the administration had notified Congress in early February it would raise the cap to the 62,500 figure—half the 125,000 ceiling Mr. Biden had pledged to put in place beginning next fiscal year.<br />The cap increase comes eight months into the government’s fiscal year, meaning it is unlikely that the full 62,500 people will enter the U.S. before Sept. 30. The U.S. has admitted just over 2,000 refugees so far this year, by far the lowest ever."
