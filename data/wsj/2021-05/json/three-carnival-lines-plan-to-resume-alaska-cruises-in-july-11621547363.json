    "body": "Carnival Corp.  said it is planning to resume Alaska cruises in July, in what would be among the first sailings out of the U.S. since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The company said Thursday that its Princess Cruises, Holland America Line and Carnival Cruise Line plan to return to service with Alaska itineraries out of Seattle this summer.<br />The company said each brand is planning to have one ship sailing round-trip this season. The cruises are available to guests who have had their final dose of an approved Covid-19 vaccine at least 14 days before the cruise begins and proof of vaccination.<br />“Crew vaccinations will be in accordance with CDC guidelines,” Carnival said.<br />The announcement comes after the U.S. House of Representatives Thursday passed a bill that would let cruise ships sail directly from Washington state to Alaska, temporarily waiving a part of maritime law prohibiting foreign-flagged vessels from transporting passengers between two U.S. ports. Foreign-flagged vessels, such as cruise ships, had been required to stop at a foreign port—Canada, in this case—under U.S. law. Canada currently bans large cruise ships from sailing on its waters until the end of February 2022."
