    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. is asking Mexico to review alleged tampering of a union vote at a  General Motors Co.  truck factory there, in the first use of a new labor-rule enforcement tool under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.<br />The U.S. made the request after receiving information “appearing to indicate serious violations” of workers’ rights during a recent vote to approve a collective bargaining agreement at GM’s Silao assembly plant in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, according to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai.<br />GM has retained a third-party firm to review the situation and will cooperate with the U.S. and Mexican governments, a spokeswoman said.<br />“As a company, we respect and support the rights of our employees to make a personal choice about union representation and any collective bargaining on their behalf,” she said.<br />The Mexican embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
