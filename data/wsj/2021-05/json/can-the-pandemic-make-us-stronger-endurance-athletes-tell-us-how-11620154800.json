People who endure adversity or trauma—such as an illness or accident, a death of a loved one or a natural disaster—often feel more confident, resilient and brave afterward. Psychologists call this “post-traumatic growth.”<br />Endurance athletes, who typically prevail through extreme emotional as well as physical challenges, often experience a type of post-traumatic growth. Through years of training and experience, they build an increased sense of personal strength. They also learn important skills of emotional management, including how to maintain confidence, persevere, be resilient and conquer fear and anxiety. These are lessons they take on to the next competition—and that have a permanent impact on their mind-set and attitude well beyond the playing field.<br />I asked four endurance athletes what hard-earned advice they have. Here’s what they had to say.<br />Naji Ali, 56, swims three to four times a week year-round in San Francisco Bay—alone in water that can fall into the low 50s Fahrenheit in the winter. He has completed the crossing from Alcatraz Island to the mainland about 10 times and has swum approximately 10 miles from the Point Bonita Lighthouse to the San Francisco Bay Bridge."
