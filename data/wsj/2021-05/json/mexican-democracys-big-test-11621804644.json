    "body": "Mexico’s June 6 elections may be the most important for the country since the end of 71-year one-party rule in 2000. They are no small matter for the U.S. either.<br />Up for grabs are unicameral state legislatures in 30 of 32 states and 15 governorships. But the midterm elections for the 500 seats in the House of Representatives weigh most heavily on the future of the democratic republic.<br />President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s Morena party already controls a simple majority in the Senate. If Morena and its smaller-party allies retain a two-thirds majority in the House, the president is expected to continue pushing—legally or illegally—his radical, anti-market agenda in the second half of his six-year term. If, on the other hand, his coalition wins only a simple majority, it will signal a sharp decline in public support and serve as confirmation that he has reached too far.<br />The risks to democratic capitalism if Morena has a strong showing go well beyond a damaging policy mix that lasts a few years. The messianic Mr. López Obrador’s ambition is to return Mexico to the days of state monopolies in the energy industry and a highly centralized government submissive to an all-powerful president—à la the authoritarianism of the 1970s.<br />To get there he needs to dismantle independent democratic institutions and dispense with the separation of powers. He has already shifted control of the Supreme Court in his favor, pushing one magistrate off the court by freezing his family’s financial assets and threatening a long, drawn out investigation. If the president can claim that the midterm elections give him a mandate, the temptation to further consolidate power in violation of the constitution may be too great to resist."
