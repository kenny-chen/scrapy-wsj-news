    "body": "Here’s a theory: It’s the memories you don’t see coming that you wind up remembering the most. The moments that drop out of nowhere, like they belong to somebody else. Because they’re not supposed to happen. They’re a bit of a shock, even to you.<br />Phil Mickelson on Sunday. Those four words alone: When was the last time anyone had thought about Phil Mickelson on a Sunday? And yet there he was, at age 50, triumphantly striding up the 18th fairway, Tiger Woods’s former foil, now the newly-crowned King of Kiawah, mobbed in the chaos of a khaki shorts Woodstock.<br />This was Pete and Alice Dye’s primo ocean course, waves crashing, sun primed to set, a laughably beautiful vision on an ordinary day, and now it’s a sunburned preppy madhouse. Golf seldom stirs like this, and to have it happen after a year like the past one, when protocoled players were asked to make these walks on near-empty tracks?<br />And to have it happen to Phil the Thrill? The scene felt like a rapturous release.<br />Phil! Phil! Phil!"
