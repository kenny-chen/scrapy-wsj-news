    "body": "Europe is reopening for business as faster vaccinations and months of lockdowns are finally converging to push down coronavirus infections.<br />While the pandemic continues to rage throughout swaths of the developing world, daily confirmed new cases in the European Union dropped by about two thirds between April 14 and May 19, according to Our World in Data.<br />Due to a boost in deliveries this quarter, almost one-third of European adults have received at least one dose of vaccine, double the level a month ago. On Thursday,  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  announced a new contract to deliver up to another 1.8 billion doses to the EU.<br />Europe’s initially slow vaccine deployment will leave scars on its society, economy and politics. The shortage meant the bloc couldn’t stop a resurgence in infections in spring, with cases per inhabitant rising well above U.S. and U.K. levels.<br />Between Jan. 1 and May 19, the EU registered 16.56 million coronavirus infections and 716,113 Covid-related deaths, according to Our World in Data, roughly half the bloc’s total since the start of the pandemic."
