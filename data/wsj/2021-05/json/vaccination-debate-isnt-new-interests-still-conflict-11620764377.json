    "body": "To the sensible cost-benefit analysis of Charles L. Hooper and David R. Henderson (“Youth Pay a High Price for Covid Protection,” op-ed, May 4), it can be added that such considerations were discussed in the 1760s, during the Enlightenment smallpox-inoculation debate. Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli and French scientist and man of letters Jean le Rond d’Alembert calculated and argued about the comparative life-expectancy risk and reward of being inoculated versus doing without. Both regretted the absence of age-specific mortality data for smallpox victims. Bernoulli thought existing statistics compelling enough to urge inoculation for all; d’Alembert advised waiting until fuller data became available. Today, for a different health crisis, we have such data and vastly better means of immunization, which, if used intelligently, make policy-formation easier.<br />But d’Alembert also reminds us that in policy-making we cannot escape a troubling moral dilemma. The state’s and individuals’ interests are too easily confounded. He said: The state considers its citizens “indifferently” and en masse, whereas “for each individual, the interest of self-preservation comes first.”<br />David Spadafora<br />Pinehurst, N.C."
