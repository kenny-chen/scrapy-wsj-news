    "body": "As ratings fall and viewers decamp to streaming platforms with fewer or no commercials, broadcasters are embracing the adage that imitation is the strongest form of television.<br />The big four U.S. broadcast networks are rehashing existing material more than ever, banking on familiar content to hold on to audiences and advertisers. The yearslong surge in remakes and spinoffs is set to hit new heights this fall, after networks unveiled their prime-time schedules to advertisers last week.<br />Reboots “are a safer bet but, on the negative side, it shows the networks aren’t taking any risks,” said Garth Tiedje, executive vice president of video investment for Horizon Media.<br />While that trend hasn’t dazzled Madison Avenue, which will decide in coming weeks how much to gamble on the next wave of predictable programming, broadcast networks are expected to benefit from an uptick in TV ad spending.<br />After years of ratings erosion, the networks took an especially big hit during the pandemic, with all of them down double-digit percentages in total viewers in 2020 from the previous year and most taking similar hits in viewership among key demographics."
