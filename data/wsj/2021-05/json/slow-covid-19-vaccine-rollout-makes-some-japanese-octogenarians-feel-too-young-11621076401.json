    "body": "KASUKABE, Japan—In the U.S., 12-year-olds are getting vaccinated against Covid-19. In Japan, Yasuko Minagawa, 83 years old, is too young to be eligible.<br />“I don’t know when my turn will come. All I can do is wait,” Ms. Minagawa said.<br />Her home city of Kasukabe, an hour north of Tokyo, initially limited vaccine appointments to those 90 and older and now has opened the door to the 85-to-89 cohort. Ms. Minagawa was at a vaccination center on Thursday because her husband, Michio Minagawa, 88, was getting his first shot of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE .<br />With Tokyo set to host the Summer Olympics in a little more than two months, the country is laboring through a slow rollout of vaccines. Japan offers an example of the frustrations in some countries in East Asia and the Pacific that have weathered the pandemic far better than the U.S. and Europe, yet are stuck with restrictions on daily life while the U.S. is rapidly reopening.<br />“I can’t go anywhere freely. I’d really like to go to a hot spring soon,” said 74-year-old Katsuko Tamura while using an abacus to keep the books at the hardware store she runs with her husband."
