    "body": "Some news organizations have labored over the last year to persuade  viewers that police officers constitute a major threat to many of the citizens they serve. But the citizens still aren’t buying it. Shane Dixon Kavanaugh reports for The Oregonian:<br />Even in what is arguably America’s leftwardmost political jurisdiction, it turns out that “defund the police” is a rallying cry for only a small percentage of the citizenry, despite what CNN viewers have been led to believe. The new Oregonian poll also helps puncture the myth that people of color don’t want cops in their neighborhoods. Mr. Kavanaugh reports:<br />This column recently noted that in Seattle, a large annual survey found that blacks trust the police more than whites do, and that across all demographic groups there is little support for defunding. Citizens are calling for more police in neighborhoods racked by lawlessness. If the radical and destructive policies promoted by the Black Lives Matter organization don’t sell in Portland and Seattle, where do they sell?<br />Unfortunately they remain popular nationwide among the political and media classes, notwithstanding the lack of voter support. The Journal’s Jason Riley writes today on the tragic developments on America’s other coast:<br />Regardless of what the BLM organization says, residents in various cities understand that black lives matter and deserve police protection."
