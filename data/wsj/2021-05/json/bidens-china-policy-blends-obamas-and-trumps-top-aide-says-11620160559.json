    "body": "President Biden’s approach to China borrows from the Obama administration’s efforts at cooperation and the Trump administration’s tougher line to counter Beijing’s assertiveness at home and abroad, a senior White House official said Tuesday.<br />“It’s an interesting compilation and combination—almost an amalgam—of elements from President Obama and President Trump,” said Kurt Campbell, coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs at the National Security Council, at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit. “I think there is wisdom in some of each approach, even though there’s some contradictions as well.”<br />Like the Obama administration, the Biden team—which includes some of the same top officials, including Mr. Campbell—is trying to work with Beijing on climate change as well as containing Iran’s nuclear ambitions and, potentially, North Korea.<br />“We’re interested in practical, clear areas where we could work together on issues where we share mutual concerns,” Mr. Campbell said.<br />The Biden team is also looking to join with allies to censure China for behavior Washington objects to and compete with Beijing for the lead in advanced technologies, including using investment rules—tactics employed by the Trump administration, he said."
