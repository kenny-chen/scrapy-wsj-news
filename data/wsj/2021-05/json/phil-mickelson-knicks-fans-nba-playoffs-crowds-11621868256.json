    "body": "Before he could make history as the oldest golfer to win a major championship, Phil Mickelson had to get to the 18th green. The only thing in his way was a sea of humanity.<br />Never has a professional athlete been so thrilled to be engulfed by a mob of beer-soaked fans. First they followed Mickelson. Then they surrounded him. By the time cops and PGA Championship officials had barreled through rows and rows of people to create a narrow pathway for the 50-year-old champion to squeeze through, the scene was already an unforgettable snapshot of a triumphant moment: Sports are back because sports fans are back.<br />“Considering where we are in the world right now, it was sort of weird,” said Tim Mickelson, Phil’s brother and caddie. “But it was also pretty darned cool to see.”<br />The last year has seen Tom Brady win the Super Bowl, LeBron James win the NBA championship and the Los Angeles Dodgers win the World Series. Naomi Osaka won the U.S. Open, and Rafael Nadal won the French Open. Nick Saban and Alabama won another college football national championship, and Sue Bird and the Seattle Storm won another WNBA title. There were two green jackets fitted at the Masters, a Kentucky Derby doping controversy and NCAA tournaments in bubbles.<br />But only with the return of huge, noisy, unabashedly exuberant crowds over the past week are sports beginning to feel normal again."
