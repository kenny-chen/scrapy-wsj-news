    "body": "I have to admit that before I read your editorial “Mass Hysteria for $2,000” (May 3) I was unaware that there was a “contestant community” out there and that it had taken such a unified and principled stand on the hand gestures of others, particularly those who might be perceived as fellow or aspiring members. Eagerly awaited from these gesticulation experts is the “community’s” take on gang signing by film stars, rappers, inner-city gang members, MS-13, etc., which, at least to an untrained hand-gesture critic like myself, seem to have real, intentionally nefarious meaning. OK?<br />James Gottschalk<br />Tequesta, Fla.<br /><br />Back in the ’80s when I took scuba-diving lessons, thumb and forefinger circled with three extended fingers was a signal you used to tell your dive buddy that all was OK. When used underwater does it now mean white (shark) supremacy? To those in the “contestant community” I would say that I am a cranky, old man and you are appropriating my culture. Step away from the mirror and grow up."
