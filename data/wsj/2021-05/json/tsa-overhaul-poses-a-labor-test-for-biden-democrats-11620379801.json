    "body": "DEMOCRATS MULL TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION revamp, under the watchful eye of labor unions. Around 40,000 transit security officers are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, but lack collective bargaining and whistleblower rights and are outside the normal federal pay structure, making them among the lowest-paid federal employees. That is the result of the post-Sept. 11, 2001, circumstances under which the TSA was created, when Congress wanted the agency to be able to quickly change its workforce structure following a national emergency. AFGE calls the situation for transit security officers separate and unequal, while Republicans say changing the system would lock TSA into an outdated federal bureaucracy.<br />Legislation that would alter compensation and labor rights at TSA is likely to be included in the House’s version of President Biden’s infrastructure package, along with other pro-union measures like the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, an expansive, pan-sector measure. They serve as a test of Democrats’ pro-labor bona fides—Mr. Biden aspires to the mantle of the most pro-union president in history. AFGE, along with other union and labor-rights groups, notes the challenges faced by TSA officers in recent years, especially the pandemic and the 2018-19 government shutdown, when officers worked without pay for weeks. TSA ranks among the lowest in government surveys of satisfaction with pay, and receives poor marks from employees on its workplace protections, benefits and morale.<br />A 2019 Homeland Security-commissioned panel recommended compensation changes to retain talented employees, along with beefing up TSA’s human-resources department. But the panel, which didn’t include union representatives, didn’t recommend putting TSA officers into the broader federal pay schedule system. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, the top Republican on the Transportation and Maritime Security Subcommittee, criticized the plan to move officers to the general pay scale, saying it would “force employees into an antiquated 20th-century system.” He noted the Trump administration’s threatened veto of similar prior legislation and said that pay raises should come through normal appropriations. During the Trump administration, TSA leadership pushed back on the federal pay schedule idea, and under Mr. Biden has said it is working to implement the panel’s recommendations.<br />TSA employees also have a unique ability to get face time with members of Congress: Several members of the House Homeland Security Committee considering the changes mentioned talking to officers at their local airports about pay and working conditions.<br />THE BUSH FAMILY continues to provide advice to GOP leaders about how to position the party for the future, if anyone is still listening to them. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush implored his party in an appearance with Republican strategist Bruce Mehlman to adopt a more optimistic message and to reject conspiracy theories about the outcome of the 2020 election. “This bizarre belief that the election was stolen, perpetuated by, you know, a sitting president of the United States, created an incredibly toxic environment that people rejected,” resulting in the Republican loss of two Senate seats in Georgia and control of the Senate, he said. “We’re never going to win if we’re angry all the time.”"
