    "body": "LONDON—British polluters could face higher costs for emissions in the U.K.’s new post-Brexit carbon market, a key plank of the country’s efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.<br />Futures for U.K. emission allowances changed hands at £47.11 a metric ton, or just under $67, in their trading debut on  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s  marketplace Wednesday. That placed U.K. prices about 7% above prices in the European Union’s carbon market, the world’s largest.<br />Trading on the first morning was thin: Just 52 contracts, for permits covering 52,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, changed hands by 6:40 a.m. ET.<br />Traders were awaiting the first auction for allowances at 7 a.m. ET. Just under 6.1 million permits, each allowing companies to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide or an equivalent amount of other greenhouse gases, are up for sale with results due by 9:15 a.m. ET.<br />The market went live at a time when prices in the EU’s carbon market, which the U.K. helped develop, are soaring. Prices have risen 58% this year to €51.24, or about $63, and recently touched a record. High gas prices, coupled with an influx of money from investors betting the bloc’s efforts to combat climate change will tighten carbon supplies, have fueled the climb."
