    "body": "New York Times Co.  said its revenue rose 6.6% in the first quarter, even as digital-subscriber additions slowed sharply in the months since former President Donald Trump left office.<br />The company signed up 167,000 new subscribers for its core news offering, the slowest growth since the second quarter of 2019. Including lower-cost digital products such as its cooking and gaming apps, the Times added 301,000 total digital subscriptions in the quarter, compared with 627,000 in 2020’s fourth quarter.<br />“In our last earnings call, I noted that fluctuations in the news cycle can lead to considerable variability in net digital subscription additions from quarter to quarter,” said Chief Executive Meredith Kopit Levien in remarks to investors. “In February and March, our audiences declined from their historic highs last year, and we saw fewer net subscription additions in the latter part of the quarter.”<br />Ms. Kopit Levien told investors that the company expects “moderated growth to continue through the second quarter, traditionally our softest of the year.”<br />New York Times shares were down 5% in morning trading."
