    "body": "Jeep and Chrysler maker  Stellantis  NV is joining forces with iPhone assembler  Foxconn Technology Group  in a new collaboration aimed at accelerating the development of in-car software.<br />The world’s third-largest car company by sales said Tuesday that the 50-50 joint venture, dubbed Mobile Drive, would focus on technology used in vehicle dashboard systems and other connected services.<br />The companies said the JV, which will be based in the Netherlands and sell its software to other car makers, would combine Stellantis’s expertise in vehicle design and engineering with Foxconn’s know-how in software and consumer electronics.<br />The move comes as auto makers are racing to compete with  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, Apple Inc. and other Silicon Valley giants for control of the dashboard display and other connected car features. Many car makers are betting that future growth and profits could come less from building and selling cars and more from features like connected car services and apps, a business model that is closer to the tech industry.<br />Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said the JV with Foxconn would enable “the swift development of connectivity features and services that mark the next great evolution of our industry, just as electrification technology has.”"
