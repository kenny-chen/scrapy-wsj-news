    "body": "The number of available jobs grew in April as the pace of hiring slowed, pointing to a widening gap between employers’ unfilled positions and available workers.<br />Job postings at the end of April were 24% higher than February 2020’s pre-pandemic level, according to job search site Indeed.com. Openings at the end of March were 16% above pre-pandemic levels, Indeed added.<br />The growth in available jobs came as hiring cooled to a seasonally adjusted 266,000 in April from a gain of 770,000 the prior month, according to the Labor Department.<br />“Employers are looking to hire, but temporary factors are making people a little hesitant to take jobs,” said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed. The growing number of available jobs “shows how difficult it is to turn openings into hires.”<br />Many economists say a number of factors—including expanded unemployment benefits, fear of contracting Covid-19 and a lack of child care—are keeping workers from taking open jobs. There were 7.4 million unfilled jobs at the end of February, according to the Labor Department. The federal gauge of openings at the end of March will be released at 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday."
