    "body": "Quibi may be dead, but the mountain of shows the short-lived, short-form streaming service commissioned have found a new home on the Roku Channel, the free, ad-supported streaming service. Roku snapped up more than 75 of the shows originally made for Quibi, renamed them Roku Originals and is making 30 of them available Thursday. They include “Die Hart” (Kevin Hart, John Travolta), “#FreeRayshawn” (Laurence Fishburne, Stephan James) “Most Dangerous Game” (Liam Hemsworth), and reboots of “Reno 911!” and “Punk’d.”<br />Here’s what else is streaming this week:<br />(Netflix)<br />When “Master of None” premiered on Netflix in 2015, the series was squarely about co-creator Aziz Ansari’s character, Dev, a 30-something struggling to find his footing in both work and love. But when the series returns Sunday for its third season—called “Master of None Presents: Moments in Love”—Dev will be a supporting character. The five-episode season focuses on Lena Waithe’s Denise, Dev’s friend with whom, as depicted in season 2, he spent Thanksgivings growing up.<br />In the new season, Denise has the things she thinks she’s wanted. She is now a married, best-selling author with a large, beautiful home in the country. As her marriage falls apart, she begins to rethink her priorities."
