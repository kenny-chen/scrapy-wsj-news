    "body": "Speculators in cryptocurrencies and in meme stocks like  GameStop Corp.  have been bragging for months about earning “10X” or even “100X”—10-fold or 100-fold profits.<br />That’s nothing.<br />Here’s how you can make more than 170X, raising your return 177-fold in a single trade. Move your cash from a bank account, where it’s probably earning about 0.02%, into an inflation-protected U.S. savings bond, which will yield 3.54% annualized. Unlike daredevil stock or crypto trading, buying an “I bond” is almost risk-free and delivers significant tax advantages.<br />Economists say there’s no such thing as a free lunch, but I bonds offer a guarantee from the U.S. government that you can recover your original capital plus any increases in the official cost of living along the way. The only catch is that this isn’t an all-you-can-eat buffet: The maximum purchase is $10,000 per year per account holder (unless you elect to take your tax refund in the form of an I bond).<br />Ironically, the less you earn and have to invest, the more powerful a tool I bonds are. Sorry, Mr. Bezos."
