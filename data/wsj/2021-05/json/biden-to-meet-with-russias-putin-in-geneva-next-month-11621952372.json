    "body": "President Biden will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 16 in Geneva.<br />The first in-person meeting between the two leaders since Mr. Biden became president will take place against the backdrop of rising tensions between Washington and Moscow. It is expected to follow Mr. Biden’s trip to the Group of Seven summit in England and a NATO gathering in Brussels, his first foreign trip as president.<br />The White House had been discussing a meeting with Mr. Putin in recent weeks but hadn’t finalized a date and location. The agenda is likely to cover topics including nuclear proliferation, climate change and Russia’s efforts to interfere in foreign elections.<br />“The leaders will discuss the full range of pressing issues, as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the U.S.-Russia relationship,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.<br />Ms. Psaki said Mr. Biden would also use the meeting to underscore U.S. support for Ukraine’s sovereignty amid a surge of Russian troops at the Ukraine border and to communicate the administration’s concerns over the recent diversion of a Ryanair flight by Belarus and Russia’s support for its leader, Alexander Lukashenko."
