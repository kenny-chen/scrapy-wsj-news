    "body": "U.S. stock futures retreated Thursday, suggesting that the major indexes will tumble for a fourth consecutive day.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 edged down 0.4%, and contracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 0.6%. Nasdaq-100 futures retreated 0.3% Thursday, pointing to moderate losses for technology stocks after the opening bell.<br />The major indexes dropped Wednesday, leaving the S&P 500 and Dow suffering their steepest three-day declines since late October.<br />Investors are jittery after consumer prices surged higher in April, prompting concerns that the Federal Reserve may move on interest rates or scale back bond purchases sooner than expected. Fed officials have repeatedly said that they expect any jump in inflation to be transitory, but some investors aren’t convinced. The threat of higher inflation is sapping money managers’ appetite for highflying technology shares and other growth stocks.<br />“The major issue we see is that valuations for many parts of the market are rich,” said Salman Baig, a multiasset investment manager at Unigestion."
