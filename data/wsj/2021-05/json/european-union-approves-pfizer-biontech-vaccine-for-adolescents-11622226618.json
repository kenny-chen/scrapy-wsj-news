    "body": "The European Union’s health agency approved the Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  for children between the ages of 12 and 15 years old, a move that will give a boost to the continent’s vaccination campaign.<br />The decision on Friday by the European Medicines Agency greatly increases the pool of people in the EU who can be vaccinated at a time when the infection rate has begun falling quickly. The U.S. began administering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to kids 12 to 15 earlier this month.<br />The EMA gave the green light after reviewing data from a trial in which none of the 1,005 children who got the vaccine developed Covid-19. Of the 978 who got the placebo, 16 got Covid. The results were similar to those from a trial in the U.S. concluded earlier this year.<br />Europe’s vaccination campaign has been accelerating in recent weeks, leading to a steep drop in infections and deaths. Daily confirmed new cases in the EU have fallen by three-quarters since the beginning of April, according to Our World in Data. Daily deaths are down by almost 70%, compared with six weeks ago.<br />In a sign of the advancing vaccination campaign on Friday, Italy said that beginning June 3 all people over the age of 16 can sign up to get vaccinated."
