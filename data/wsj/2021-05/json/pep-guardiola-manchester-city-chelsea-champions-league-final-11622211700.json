    "body": "Once his detailed tactical instructions are done, and after his last-minute audibles, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola likes to ask his team to remember why they became soccer players in the first place.<br />And before they can answer, he reminds them: it’s because they love to have the ball at their feet.<br />It might be a simple point, but it’s at the core of Guardiola’s attacking philosophy. Possession is everything. The surprising part is that it’s also at the heart of how his teams defend—Guardiola-ball has always been one long game of keep-away. “Maybe one day they will change the rules,” Guardiola joked to Sky Sports this season, “but I think to score a goal you need the ball.”<br />Yet even by Guardiola’s own standards, he has never had a defensive season quite like this one. The manager who built irresistible attacking machines, from Barcelona to Bayern Munich to Man City, has now added unrelenting defense to his arsenal. The club has conceded just seven goals in 12 games on its way to Saturday’s Champions League final against Chelsea, a career low for Guardiola. It’s facing just 6.3 shots per match.<br />“There’s been a slight shift season,” former Liverpool defender and CBS analyst Jamie Carragher said. “They’re a lot less predictable than what they were.”"
