    "body": "Paying more for diapers? Blame the Texas freeze.<br />The February storm that closed chemical plants across Texas, hobbling production of goods from car parts to smartphones, continues to reverberate throughout the global supply chain.<br />One product that remains in short supply is acrylic acid, the propylene-based compound that makes diapers absorbent. Executives and industry consultants say that shortfall is still a factor in the fast-rising prices of diapers even as demand declines.<br />Suppliers of acrylic acid “just got hammered,” said Michael Murray, who with his two brothers runs DeSales Trading Company Inc., a company that buys and sells so-called superabsorbent polymers made with acrylic acid. “Supply is extremely tight right now.”<br />The global supply chain is in broad upheaval, upended by pandemic- and weather-related production disruptions, demand swings and surging raw materials costs. Diapers are one of many consumer products that are getting more expensive."
