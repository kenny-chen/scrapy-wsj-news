The Canadian border remains closed for now, but as soon as it opens, bring on the brasseries and smoked meat.<br />In the meantime, start plotting ravenous travels across our neighbor to the north with the Audible podcast “Field Guide to Eating in Canada.” Host Meredith Erickson, a food writer and veteran of Montreal’s vital restaurant scene, begins in that city and then, over the course of nine more episodes, talks to foragers in the Gaspésie, indigenous chefs in Alberta, dim sum doyens in B.C., and more. It’s hard to imagine a more curious, gregarious or knowledgeable guide, or a vicarious vacation more satisfying. audible.com<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page."
