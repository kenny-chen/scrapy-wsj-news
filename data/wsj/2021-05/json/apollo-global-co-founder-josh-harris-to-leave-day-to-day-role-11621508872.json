    "body": "Josh Harris, co-founder of  Apollo Global Management Inc.,  will step down from day-to-day responsibilities at the firm early next year to focus on his personal investments, the firm said.<br />Mr. Harris, who for years oversaw daily operations at Apollo, was sidelined in January when the firm said Chief Executive Leon Black would cede his role to co-founder Marc Rowan later in the year after revelations of Mr. Black’s ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.<br />Apollo had said in July 2020 that Mr. Rowan would take a step back from his regular responsibilities and embark on a “semisabbatical.” To some people close to the firm, that seemed to pave the way for Mr. Harris to take the top executive spot.<br />Mr. Black in March stepped down as chairman, citing health issues, and formally handed the CEO role to Mr. Rowan.<br />Apollo said Mr. Harris would remain a board member and a member of the firm’s executive committee but would end his day-to-day involvement with the investment giant after the closing of its deal to acquire insurance affiliate  Athene Holding Ltd. , expected in the first quarter of 2022."
