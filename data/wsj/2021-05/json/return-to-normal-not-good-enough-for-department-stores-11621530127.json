    "body": "Kohl’s  and  Macy’s  are getting almost back to where they were before the pandemic struck. Unfortunately for them, competitors are already well ahead of that.<br />In the quarter ended May 1, Kohl’s and Macy’s saw net sales rebound 70% and 56%, respectively, compared with a year earlier, as shoppers looked to refresh their stale wardrobes. Dressier categories, including even tailored clothes, are making a comeback, Macy’s noted in its earnings call on Tuesday.<br />The bounceback was largely to be expected after a dismal comparable quarter last year, when stores had to close due to Covid-19 restrictions. A comparison to pre-pandemic numbers yields a more sober outlook: Measured against the same quarter in 2019, Kohl’s net sales declined 4.2%, while comparable sales at Macy’s fell 10.5%.<br />One positive surprise was a turn to profitability for the two department store giants; analysts polled by FactSet had expected a net loss from both. But that was partly thanks to factors outside of the retailers’ control: Port congestion has led to less inventory across the apparel industry, leading to more full-priced selling. Inventory declined 25% at Kohl’s compared with a year earlier and fell 14% at Macy’s.<br />Kohl’s shares fell 10% after it reported Thursday, and Macy’s is down around 5% since reporting earlier in the week. Yet they are both trading at prices higher than pre-pandemic levels."
