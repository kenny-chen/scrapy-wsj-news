    "body": "Sanofi SA  and  GlaxoSmithKline  PLC said their Covid-19 vaccine candidate showed positive interim trial results and is expected to move into large-scale human trials soon, putting the long-delayed shot on track for potential regulatory approval later this year.<br />France’s Sanofi and GSK, based in the U.K., said Monday the two-dose shot produced strong antibody responses in phase-two trials with 722 volunteers. A single dose generated high levels of antibodies in volunteers with evidence of prior Covid-19 infection, the companies said, suggesting the vaccine could be useful as a booster for people already vaccinated with other shots.<br />Now the companies plan to begin pivotal phase-three trials, which will involve more than 35,000 people, and use two formulations: one targeting the original Covid-19 strain that circulated last year, and the second aimed at the strain that was originally detected in South Africa.<br />Sanofi and GSK fell behind other vaccine makers last year when they abandoned previous human trials after a miscalculation in the manufacturing process resulted in erroneously lower doses.<br />Their partnership combines a Sanofi-owned antigen—a protein from the coronavirus that triggers an immune response—and a GSK-owned adjuvant, a molecule used in some vaccines to boost the level of protection. The mis-dosing required the vaccine to be reformulated for new clinical trials."
