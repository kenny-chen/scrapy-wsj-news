    "body": "Airbnb Inc.  reported more than $10 billion in bookings in the latest period while revenue recovered from the March 2020 quarter, when the pandemic devastated the travel industry.<br />But the company’s loss surged to more than $1 billion, driven by costs related to debt repayment and warrants.<br />The San Francisco company last year raced to raise money to weather the crisis, but the warrants it gave investors on those loans have significantly appreciated, leading to a $292 million noncash adjustment in the latest period.<br />Airbnb, whose stock started publicly trading in December, reported a net loss of $1.17 billion, compared with a $341 million loss a year ago.<br />Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected a $717 million loss."
