    "body": "Trainer Bob Baffert has spent the past few days saying he did not know how Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit failed a post-race drug test.<br />On Tuesday—as Medina Spirit was given the OK to enter Saturday’s Preakness Stakes—Baffert said he might have an explanation as to why betamethasone, a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation and joint pain in horses, was found in Medina Spirit’s system.<br />Baffert said after Medina Spirit’s second-place finish in the Santa Anita Derby on April 3, the horse developed dermatitis (skin irritation) on his hind end and following a vet’s recommendation was treated with an anti-fungal ointment called Otomax.<br />“[Monday] I was informed that one of the substances in Otomax is betamethasone,” Baffert said in the statement. “While we do not know definitively that this was the source of the alleged 21 picograms found in Medina Spirit’s post-race blood sample, and our investigation is continuing, I have been told by equine pharmacology experts that this could explain the test results.”<br />After Preakness Stakes officials delayed the post-position draw by a day to gather information, Medina Spirit was allowed to enter Saturday’s race. A field of 10 will contest the second leg of the Triple Crown at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore."
