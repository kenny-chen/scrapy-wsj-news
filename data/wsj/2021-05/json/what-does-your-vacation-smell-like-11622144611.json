    "body": "RARELY do we go rummaging through our brain’s olfactory files for reminders of an impressive vacation. But this is a great time to give a workout to what chef Marcus Samuelsson calls our “smell muscle,” using our sense of smell to experience more of the world. You’re sure to get your heart pumping.<br />Emerging from the cocoon we were unceremoniously stuffed into a year ago, many of us are starting to dream of returning to a favorite place—a beloved getaway spot that has been frustratingly off-limits for the past 14 months. While photos or particularly vivid TV shows might conjure the image of those out-of-reach destinations, they can’t reproduce the feeling of being there. “When we smell things we are directly experiencing little bits of that place, the materials that make up that place,” said author Harold McGee, whose most recent book, “Nose Dive: A Field Guide To The World’s Smells,” came out in the fall. The aroma of the place is perhaps the only experience we can’t transport as a souvenir.<br />Not that it hasn’t been tried. Versions of Smell-O-Vision or Scentovision, a system that transmits smells during films or television shows, first wafted onto the scene in the 1960s after Swiss scientist Hans Laube introduced it in 1939 at the World’s Fair. “It didn’t work,” said Mr. McGee, but hold tight for another decade or so and we’ll be able to visit India and share the smell experience when we return home, he predicted. Until then, we asked Mr. McGee as well as six other professionals for whom scent plays an important role to share the aromas that evoke their strongest memories of places they’re eager to sniff once again.<br />“I live in San Francisco and we’ll often go on a driving trip up the coast to Mendocino. I smell the ocean and the redwoods. The redwood forests have a particular smell—moist, evergreen, woody,” said Mr. McGee, adding that the bark on the massive trees tends to be flaky, which may contribute to the aroma. Other indelible scent memories are less agreeable. “I love visiting New York, Paris and London. I think of the smell of the subways,” said Mr. McGee. “In Paris, the subways have rubber wheels, and that may be what gives it its distinct smell. The London subways are deep underground. You feel the stifle of air. In New York, walking along the streets you pass the subway grates, you smell the subway more than the street. Not always pleasant.”<br />Ms. Burch’s most memorable vacation smell comes from the Caribbean. “A flower called Lady of the Night blooms in the evening at our home in Antigua,” said Ms. Burch. “The scent is magnificent—a floral with tremendous depth. It travels from room to room and throughout the gardens with the wind.”"
