    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans are crafting a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure offer to present to the White House later this week, preparing a substantial increase to their original $568 billion plan in hopes of sustaining bipartisan talks that hit hurdles last week.<br />The six Senate Republicans who have been leading talks met Tuesday morning to discuss how to respond to the $1.7 trillion plan the White House released last week, a drop from the Biden administration’s original $2.3 trillion proposal. Members of the group said they would send their new plan to the White House on Thursday, days before an unofficial Memorial Day deadline for progress in the talks.<br />Sen. Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), the top Republican on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said President Biden told the GOP lawmakers during a private meeting earlier this month that he would support a $1 trillion plan over eight years.  Mr. Wicker said the Republican offer would roughly match Mr. Biden’s comments in the meeting.<br />“We’re gonna make it eight years, as the president said he would accept, we’re going to hit a figure very close to what the president said he would accept,” Mr. Wicker said.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki didn’t comment on whether Mr. Biden had signaled support for a $1 trillion plan, saying instead that he had signed off on the $1.7 trillion offer. She said the White House looked forward to receiving a new GOP offer."
