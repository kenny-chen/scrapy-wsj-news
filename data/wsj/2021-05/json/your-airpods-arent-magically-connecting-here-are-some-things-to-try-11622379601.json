    "body": "<br />Apple’s website touts the AirPods’ ability to “connect magically” to iPhones and “move seamlessly” between iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Macs. For many, the popular Bluetooth earbuds work as billed. But for others—including me—AirPods have become AirProblems.<br />Last September, I wrote a one-year review of the AirPods Pro, praising their top-notch noise-cancellation, new spatial audio feature and even their ease of pairing. After that column, colleagues and readers flooded my inbox with emails detailing various connection and switching mishaps.<br />This year, I started experiencing a frustration of my own. When there’s an incoming call and I put the Pros in my ears, “Nic Pods connected” appears on screen, but when I answer the call, I can’t hear anyone on the other end, because the audio source is set to the phone’s speaker.<br />Melissa Jean Clark is a Toronto-based web designer who uses AirPods Pro to listen to Spotify on her MacBook Pro while she works. When Ms. Clark reviews projects on her iPhone, the earbuds switch to that device instead. “I lose my focus. Every time I pick up my phone, they’ll connect to it, and it goes back and forth over and over,” she said."
