    "body": "As the U.S. looks forward to the opening of businesses, schools and universities, there is much discussion about requiring proof of vaccination (“Vaccines Become Required for Hires,” Business & Finance, April 27). This leaves out the thousands of study volunteers across the U.S. who have been vaccinated with vaccines that have yet to be granted emergency-use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration. Vaccine-study data from AstraZeneca PLC and Novavax Inc. will be presented to the FDA in the coming months, but the timeline is unclear.<br />This leaves these study volunteers in limbo with their employers or schools despite the fact that these vaccines have approval in other countries or have shown safety and efficacy in other large studies. I have discouraged my study participants from receiving another vaccine that has been granted an EUA because I don’t feel it is necessary for them to be revaccinated. I ask that the FDA and companies work closely together to expedite the process, and also that other entities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local departments of health recognize the important contributions of our study volunteers without impeding their education or livelihoods.<br />Prof. Karen Tashima, M.D.<br />Brown University<br />Providence, R.I."
