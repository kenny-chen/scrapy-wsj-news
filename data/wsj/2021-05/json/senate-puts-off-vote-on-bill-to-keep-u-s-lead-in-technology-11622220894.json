    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate on Friday delayed a vote on legislation aimed at helping the U.S. maintain its lead in technology, after several Republicans argued that the bill was being rushed through without full debate.<br />The final vote on the bill, aimed at addressing rising competition from China and other nations, is now scheduled for June 8, after lawmakers return from their Memorial Day recess.<br />The legislation has emerged as one of the few big bipartisan legislative efforts so far this year, and appeared headed for approval late Thursday.<br />But several Republicans staged a lengthy protest into the early hours of Friday morning, contending that the bill was too expensive, and that a series of amendments required more time to review.<br />“There’s not one person in this entire place who could possibly comprehend everything that’s in this legislation in its current form, as it existed as of very, very late last night,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R. Utah). “And so as a result, it’s not a horrible thing to suggest, let’s put off voting for a few days.”"
