    "body": "Regarding John Ellis’s “Sorry, Prof, We’re Cutting You Off” (op-ed, May 3): I have a simple solution to the problem of universities hijacking the traditional role of higher education. They made it political, so let’s respond politically. One of the favorite bludgeons of the left is to use disparities in market participants as proof of bias (disparate impact). By this definition, clearly there are huge disparities (proof of bias, according to Democrats) in the political leanings of university professors and administrators—estimated at upward of 90% self-proclaimed Democrats.<br />In the name of fairness I propose that if any university wants to benefit from federal loans to finance its student body, it would be required to ensure that conservative values aren’t marginalized by the progressive majority. Those applying for employment at the university (professors, adjuncts and administrators) who identify as non-Democrats should be first in line to be hired until the political imbalance is rectified. Would the Democrats sacrifice their disparate-impact argument to protect their captured universities?<br />Michael W. Kenworthy<br />Chester, Vt.<br />"
