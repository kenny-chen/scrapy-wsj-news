    "body": "TEL AVIV—Israeli right-wing politician Naftali Bennett said Sunday he plans to join a rival in a coalition opposed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, paving the way for the formation of a government that would end the incumbent’s more than decadelong grip on power.<br />“It is my intention to act with all my power to establish a national unity government with my friend Yair Lapid so that we can save this country from this spiral and get it back on path,” Mr. Bennett said. “We can stop this insanity and take responsibility.”<br />Mr. Bennett’s Yamina party is expected to be the main partner to Yair Lapid’s centrist Yesh Atid party in the coalition. Mr. Lapid received the mandate to form a government earlier this month after Mr. Netanyahu first failed to do so following an inconclusive March election, the country’s fourth since 2019.<br />Efforts to form a ruling coalition could still collapse as many parties from across the political spectrum try and agree on the government’s agenda and cabinet portfolios. It would also likely need the outside support of Israel’s Arab parties.<br />Mr. Lapid has until June 2 to inform the president of his government formation plan. If he fails to do so, President Reuven Rivlin would then hand responsibility for selecting a new prime minister back to Israel’s parliament before a new election is called."
