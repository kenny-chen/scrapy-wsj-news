    "body": "Germany’s financial regulator has told N26 Bank GmbH, a hot digital startup with operations in Europe and the U.S., to implement proper controls to prevent money laundering, taking the unusual step of appointing a special monitor to watch over the process.<br />The regulator, BaFin, said Wednesday that it made the decision after it found that deficiencies in money-laundering prevention remained two years after it ordered the bank to make improvements.<br />It cited problems in customer due diligence and information-technology monitoring. It also told the bank it needs to have adequate staff and resources to comply with its obligations.<br />BaFin’s move follows the collapse of fintech darling Wirecard AG last year amid allegations of fraud and money laundering. The regulator has been sharply criticized for failing to act despite several signs of trouble. Its president left the post last year.<br />The other bank where BaFin has appointed a special monitor is Deutsche Bank AG. Last month, the regulator expanded the role of the monitor, KPMG, and told the lender to do more to prevent financial crime, after it found shortcomings. KPMG was appointed in 2018."
