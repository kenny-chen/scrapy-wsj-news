    "body": "Mark P. Mills’s “Biden’s Not-So-Clean Energy Transition” (op-ed, May 12) provides an erroneous and incomplete summary of the findings of our recent report, “The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions.” Our analysis is the most comprehensive global study to date on the central importance of minerals such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt and rare-earth elements in a secure and rapid transformation of the global energy sector. While it warns of a mismatch between the world’s strengthened climate ambitions and the availability of these essential critical minerals, the report specifically shows that these challenges aren’t insurmountable. In fact, we provide six key areas of action for policy makers to ensure that critical minerals enable an accelerated transition to clean energy. The International Energy Agency is absolutely committed to helping countries address climate change, including their ambitions to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.<br />Jad Mouawad<br />International Energy Agency<br />Paris<br />"
