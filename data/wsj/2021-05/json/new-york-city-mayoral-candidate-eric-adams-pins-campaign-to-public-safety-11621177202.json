    "body": "A leading Democratic candidate to become New York City’s next mayor says his path to a career in law enforcement and then public office began 45 years ago in a basement of a Queens police precinct.<br />Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a retired Black New York Police Department captain, said he was 15 years old at the time and his brother, Conrad, 16. The siblings—two of six growing up in a working-class household in South Jamaica, Queens—had been arrested after entering the home of a neighborhood go-go dancer to demand money she owed them for running errands, Mr. Adams said.<br />In the basement of the 103rd precinct, the brothers were beaten by two white officers, then forced to spend the night in a juvenile detention center, according to Mr. Adams. The NYPD declined to comment.<br />Mr. Adams, now 60, has spoken publicly in the past about the experience and said that the criminal case was sealed. He said he “turned his pain into purpose” by becoming a cop.<br />Today, he is among the top candidates in a 12-person field competing in the June 22 Democratic primary to replace term-limited Democrat Bill de Blasio. The winner likely will prevail in November’s general election because registered Democrats outnumber Republicans citywide by more than 6 to 1."
