    "body": "The Democratic candidates for Manhattan district attorney are expected to tackle a range of issues Tuesday night during the race’s first and perhaps only televised debate, such as the role of a prosecutor, alternatives to incarceration and inequities in the justice system.<br />Unlike past races where contenders competed to be the toughest on crime, most of the eight Democratic candidates have promised broad changes to a system that they say has handed out punitive sentences and disproportionately affected communities of color.<br />The June 22 Democratic primary is likely to decide who will ultimately succeed Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who isn’t running for re-election. Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans in Manhattan.<br />The debate, hosted by NY1, was recorded in advance of Tuesday night, with a format that included brief opening statements before candidates answered questions posed by moderator Errol Lewis. The candidates were also able to ask questions of their opponents during one portion of the evening.<br />Though the candidates have participated in numerous candidate forums, all held virtually, the debate marks a potential moment that could influence the outcome of the race."
