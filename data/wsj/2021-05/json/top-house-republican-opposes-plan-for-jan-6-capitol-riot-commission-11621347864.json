    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said he opposed plans for a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, dismissing the independent probe as counterproductive and shortsighted.<br />But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Republicans in his chamber are undecided and “willing to listen” to arguments about whether a commission is needed.<br />Mr. McCarthy’s public opposition to the commission proposal—and Mr. McConnell’s suggestion that he was open to it—underscored the tensions on Capitol Hill over Jan. 6, and the divisions within the Republican Party over how to reckon with the events of that day, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol to try to stop ratification of President Biden’s Electoral College victory.<br />Some Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have played down the severity of the assault, which resulted in the deaths of five people and the injury of 140 law-enforcement officials. Mr. Trump was impeached in the House over his actions related to the riot. He was acquitted in the Senate.<br />The Biden White House issued a statement in support of the commission following Mr. McCarthy’s statement Tuesday. “The nation deserves such a full and fair accounting to prevent future violence and strengthen the security and resilience of our democratic institutions,” the statement said."
