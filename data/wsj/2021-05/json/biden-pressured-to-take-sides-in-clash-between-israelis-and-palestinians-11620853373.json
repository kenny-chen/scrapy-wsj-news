    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is urging a de-escalation in deadly clashes between the Israeli military and the Islamist Hamas movement, while some Democratic allies call for stronger support for Palestinians and some Republicans want more forceful backing of Israel.<br />President Biden and his top national security advisers have avoided playing a major public role or taking sides in the crisis, which was ignited by a series of disputes in Jerusalem in recent days, culminating in Hamas rocket attacks on Jerusalem and Israeli reprisals.<br />“The most important thing that we can do right now is exactly what we’re doing, which is to be engaged across the board, pushing on de-escalation,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday, while declining to detail U.S. plans for resolving the conflict.<br />Mr. Biden said Wednesday that he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, adding that Israel has a right to defend itself but saying his expectation is that the violence would end soon.<br />Many of Mr. Biden’s fellow Democrats want the president to more assertively support Arabs and to promote proposals from some Democrats in Congress to remove funding for Israel linked to its settlement activity in the West Bank, which Palestinians and many Democrats oppose."
