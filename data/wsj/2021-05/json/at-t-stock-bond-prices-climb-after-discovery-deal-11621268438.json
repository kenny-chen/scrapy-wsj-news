    "body": "AT&T Inc.’s  shares declined and bond prices rose Monday after the telecommunications company and  Discovery  Inc.  said they plan to combine their media assets into a new publicly traded company.<br />AT&T’s shares declined 2.7% on Monday after announcement of the deal, which would spin off the company’s WarnerMedia division, unwinding a big bet on entertainment just three years after it acquired the owner of Time Warner Inc. for about $81 billion.<br />Bond prices climbed, with analysts saying the deal would help reduce the $169 billion in net debt AT&T reported at the end of March. AT&T is the most-indebted nonfinancial U.S. company, according to FactSet data, raising worries for some about the conglomerate’s financial flexibility.<br />AT&T said it would receive $43 billion from the deal in a combination of cash, debt securities and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt. The company also plans to reduce its dividend and intends to use some of the funds to bring down debt.<br />The deal will help address investors’ concerns, AT&T Chief Financial Officer Pascal Desroches said. AT&T expects its ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will hit 2.5 times by the end of 2023—ahead of its previous goal of 2024, Mr. Desroches said."
