    "body": "WASHINGTON—The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic was concentrated among minorities, women and workers who hadn’t finished high school, according to a new survey from the Federal Reserve.<br />Three-fourths of U.S. adults reported doing at least OK financially in November 2020, a share that was unchanged from previous years, the Fed said Monday.<br />But that finding masked significant divergences in economic well-being between workers who retained their jobs and those who were laid off, households with more education and those with less, and those who have children versus those without.<br />Among adults with less than a high-school diploma, 45% reported doing at least OK financially, down from 54% in 2019. Among those with a bachelor’s degree or higher, the percentage rose to 89% from 88%, the Fed said in its annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, which polls more than 11,000 individuals.<br />“People who retained their jobs during the pandemic generally had stable or improving finances in 2020,” the Fed said. “However, those who suffered a layoff and an extended period of unemployment saw a deterioration of their financial circumstances.”"
