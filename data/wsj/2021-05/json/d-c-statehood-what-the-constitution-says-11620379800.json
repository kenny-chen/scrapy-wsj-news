    "body": "The prospect of turning Washington, D.C., into the 51st state has opponents on the offensive.<br />The U.S. House of Representatives passed the D.C. statehood bill known as H.R. 51 in April along party lines, with proponents saying the city’s residents deserve full self-rule and representation in Congress. The Senate hasn’t voted on its companion bill, S. 51.<br />Objections to the measure range from claims the District of Columbia is too small for statehood; to charges that adding two U.S. senators represents a partisan power grab; to observations that the seat of federal government is located outside state boundaries for a reason—to protect it from interference.<br />As far as the Constitution is concerned, any area can become a state as long as two conditions are met: Congress must approve the request, and if the new state will be carved from one that already exists, that state must give its consent.<br />“That’s happened a lot,” said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas who’s an expert in constitutional law. “Vermont was part of New York. Maine was part of Massachusetts. Kentucky was part of Virginia.”"
