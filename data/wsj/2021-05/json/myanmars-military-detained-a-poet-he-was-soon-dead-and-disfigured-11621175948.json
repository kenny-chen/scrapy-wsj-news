    "body": "The last thing Chaw Su said to her husband was, “Run!”<br />It was around 10 p.m. on May 8, and security forces were closing in on a home in central Myanmar where they were visiting her parents. Her husband, 44-year-old poet and political activist Khet Thi, jumped over a fence into a neighbor’s backyard. Moments later, he was detained, his wife said in a phone interview.<br />The next day, authorities told Ms. Chaw Su her husband had suffered cardiac arrest and died. When she retrieved his body from the hospital, he was almost unrecognizable, she said. His face and hands were disfigured, his legs were etched with wounds from being beaten and burned, and a scar stretched down the middle of his abdomen, sewn up with messy sutures, Ms. Chaw Su said.<br />“They killed my husband,” she said. “They took him alive, the next day he was dead.”<br />The circumstances surrounding Mr. Khet Thi’s death have heightened fears among families and human rights advocates about the fate of thousands of people being held in custody by Myanmar’s military regime that seized power in a Feb. 1 coup. Before him, two members of the ousted ruling party were also discovered dead after they were detained. Lawyers representing other detainees say a number of their clients have reported being taken to interrogation centers and subjected to beatings, starvation and other abuse."
