    "body": "The wild ride in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies accelerated over the weekend, with bitcoin prices falling back near $30,000 and flirting with their lowest levels since late January.<br />After a punishing selloff last week, bitcoin dropped to $32,919.75 on Sunday afternoon, according to CoinDesk, down 14% over the previous 24 hours and more than 50% from its mid-April high. Bitcoin’s total market value has fallen below $630 billion, down from more than $1 trillion earlier this spring.<br />By early Monday morning, bitcoin’s price stabilized to trade near $36,700.<br />“Bitcoin’s intense rollercoaster ride from $18,000 to $64,000 and back to $30,000 over the past six months is a reminder that digital assets are volatile investments,” Julian Emanuel, managing director and chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said in a Sunday research note.<br />Mr. Emanuel said his year-end price target on bitcoin is $50,000, and he called any near-term volatility tied to regulatory concerns a buying opportunity."
