    "body": "Stemming New York’s rise in violent crime and helping the city recover from the Covid-19 pandemic will require more police officers and overtime spending, New York Police Department Commissioner Dermot Shea said Tuesday.<br />Mr. Shea, at a city council hearing on the city’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year, said that overtime spending is at a 15-year low. He urged against spending cuts to his department, which lost some funding last year and has faced calls for further reductions from some city lawmakers.<br />The NYPD’s proposed annual expense budget for the coming fiscal year is $5.44 billion, which is 5.5% of the city’s $98.56 billion overall proposed budget. There are currently 35,030 uniformed members and 15,646 civilian members of the department, according to the NYPD.<br />The current fiscal year’s budget allocates nearly $271 million in overtime for the department, according to Bernard O’Brien, a police budget analyst at the city’s Independent Budget Office. The NYPD already has exceeded that amount this year, Mr. O’Brien said.<br />A total of $837.5 million was spent on NYPD overtime last year, and an average of $740.4 million over the past five years."
