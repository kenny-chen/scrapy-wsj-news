    "body": "Minnesota Timberwolves rookie Anthony Edwards, the No. 1 pick in last year’s NBA draft, was asked last month if he was a fan of the person who was negotiating to buy his team: former Major League Baseball star Alex Rodriguez.<br />“I don’t know who that is,” he said.<br />Edwards will soon know him as his boss: Rodriguez and billionaire entrepreneur Marc Lore reached a deal to purchase the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves and the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx for $1.5 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br />While the agreement is pending league approval, the teams confirmed the sale in a Friday statement.<br />The deal positions Rodriguez, a generational athletic talent who was suspended for doping and then became a face of baseball in retirement, to be a significant presence in basketball for decades to come. Glen Taylor, the billionaire Minnesota businessman who owns the team, has said he expected to remain involved through 2023, when Rodriguez and Lore would take over as the controlling owners."
