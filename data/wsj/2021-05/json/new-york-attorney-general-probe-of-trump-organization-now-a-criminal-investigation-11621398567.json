    "body": "The New York attorney general’s office’s investigation of former President Donald Trump’s business now has a criminal component, a spokesman said Tuesday night, joining the Manhattan district attorney’s office probe and expanding a monthslong inquiry that until now had been focused on civil fraud.<br />“We have informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the organization is no longer purely civil in nature,” said Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office. “We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA.”<br />The Manhattan district attorney’s office is conducting an investigation into possible bank fraud and other potential crimes. Separately, the top local prosecutor in the Atlanta area is probing whether Mr. Trump improperly tried to influence election officials last year.<br />The Trump Organization didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation, which was reported earlier by CNN.<br />Mr. Trump has previously called the investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, a partisan “witch hunt.”"
