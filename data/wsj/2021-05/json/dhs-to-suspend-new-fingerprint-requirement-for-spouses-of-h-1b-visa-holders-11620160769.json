    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Department of Homeland Security will suspend a requirement that some spouses of immigrants legally employed in the U.S. submit new fingerprints to renew their visas.<br />The requirement, put in place by the Trump administration in 2019, had resulted in tens of thousands of immigrants losing their work permits amid visa processing delays.<br />U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the DHS agency that handles legal immigration, said in a court filing Monday night that it will lift the requirement for two years beginning May 17. The Trump administration, in introducing the rule, had said new fingerprints were necessary to ensure immigrant spouses weren’t misrepresenting themselves.<br />USCIS said in a statement that it would make more information about the change public in the coming days.<br />Lawyers representing spouses of H-1B and L-1 visa recipients in a class-action lawsuit against the government argued that the requirement was meant to slow visa processing for the spouses."
