    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Vaccine IP Debacle” (May 7) on the damage President Biden’s Covid IP giveaway is going to cause makes me wonder where the CEOs of these companies are and why they aren’t leading the charge instead of leaving it to the Journal? Is this another example of spineless, “woke” CEOs trying to burnish their social-warrior credentials at the expense of their companies and shareholders? As a shareholder in many of these companies, I’m appalled at the lack of action.<br />Kirk Schlup<br />Liberty Township, Ohio<br /><br />I draw your attention to Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of our Constitution. For nearly 30 years, I assisted my employer in its efforts to protect its intellectual property from nations and individuals who hold no respect for others’ ideas. In every non-courtroom fight in which we engaged, I could always depend on the local U.S. embassy or consulate to have our back, as they did for other companies, large and small. The president’s “waiver” will be seen as a door opener for every nation across the globe to ignore America’s protection of innovation, and as a slap in the face to every American who secured such protections for their ideas and who depends on the U.S. government, and our president, to abide by Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of our Constitution."
