    "body": "Priyanka and Ragu Murthy jokingly refer to themselves as the “Murthy Family of Losers.”  That’s because they’re constantly losing wallets, keys and their TV remote.<br />Ms. Murthy, the 38-year-old CEO of a fine jewelry business, recently went to work without her laptop.  Her husband, a 40-year-old cardiologist, usually returns five minutes after leaving their Jacksonville, Fla., home because he forgot his stethoscope or his phone.<br />“I was voted ‘Most Disorganized’ in high school,” Dr. Murthy said.<br />Now they attach Tiles, those little Bluetooth-powered trackers, to everything. But they’ve lost those, too, and even dropped some in water.<br />Their 4-year-old son, Raaghuv, has apparently inherited his parents’ absent-mindedness. He frequently misplaces his favorite blanket, so the Murthys affixed a Tile sticker to it so they can locate it at bedtime."
