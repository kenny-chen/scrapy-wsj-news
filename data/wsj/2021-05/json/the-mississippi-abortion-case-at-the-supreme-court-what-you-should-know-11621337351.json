    "body": "The question of abortion rights is making a return to the Supreme Court, with justices on Monday agreeing to hear a challenge to a Mississippi law that bans abortions after about 15 weeks of pregnancy.<br />More directly than in other recent abortion cases, the court is positioned to revisit the long-recognized constitutional right to an abortion before fetal viability that stems from its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.<br />Here are some questions and answers about the case and its implications.<br />The Supreme Court said it would hear the case titled Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. At issue is a challenge to Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, a 2018 law that prohibited doctors from performing abortions after 15 weeks of gestation except in medical emergency or in case of severe fetal abnormality.<br />Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only licensed abortion facility in the state, sued to overturn the law. A district court and a federal appeals court said the law was unconstitutional, prompting Mississippi’s appeal to the Supreme Court."
