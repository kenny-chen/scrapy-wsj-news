    "body": "OTTAWA—Canada wants to force YouTube, TikTok and other video- and audio-sharing sites to prominently feature more of the country’s artists, a move that digital-law experts and former government officials call one of the most aggressive internet regulations yet from a Western country.<br />The aim to promote domestic content on the sites is a step in the Canadian government’s multipronged effort to get the world’s biggest digital companies to contribute more financially to the country’s economy. Canada has vowed to levy a digital-services tax starting in 2022, regardless of whether there is a global deal among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development members on such a tax this summer.<br />The Liberal government also intends to follow Australia in trying to get digital platforms to compensate media outlets for content, and to create a new regulator to police hate speech and other harmful online activity.<br />The content proposal, unveiled last month, has generated criticism from rival politicians, law professors and net-neutrality advocates, who argue it is akin to an attack on free speech.<br />“The government is talking about picking winners and losers in the sector of free expression,” said Philip Palmer, a former senior lawyer at Canada’s justice department who three decades ago helped draft the current rules governing the broadcast sector, and who opposes the current effort."
