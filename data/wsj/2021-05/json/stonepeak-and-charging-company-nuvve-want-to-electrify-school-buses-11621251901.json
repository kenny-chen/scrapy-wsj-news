    "body": "Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners and electric-vehicle charging company  Nuvve Holding Corp.  are forming a joint venture aimed at accelerating the transition to electric school buses, a Biden administration priority.<br />The New York private-equity firm and its portfolio company  Evolve Transition Infrastructure  LP will commit as much as $750 million toward the new entity, to be called Levo Mobility LLC, the companies said. Nuvve, based in San Diego, will contribute its technology, which uses vehicles’ batteries to store energy and push it back to the grid while the vehicles are parked and plugged in.<br />The Stonepeak investment will come in the form of preferred equity. Together with Evolve, Stonepeak will own 49% of Levo’s common equity, with Nuvve owning the remaining 51%.<br />Founded in 2010, Nuvve started trading publicly in March, when it merged with a blank-check company. It is expected to announce the joint venture ahead of its first-quarter earnings report on Monday.<br />The company’s technology, known as vehicle-to-grid charging, addresses a central issue with the transition to electric vehicles: While replacing fossil-fuel-powered vehicles with electric ones reduces emissions, the rise in the number of electric vehicles also increases the demand on the grid."
