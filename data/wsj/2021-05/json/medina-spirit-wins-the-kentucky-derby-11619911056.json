    "body": "Medina Spirit took the early lead and held off Mandaloun in a thrilling stretch drive to win the 147th running of the Kentucky Derby at  Churchill Downs .<br />Trained by Bob Baffert and ridden by John Velazquez, Medina Spirit covered the 1 ¼ miles on a fast dirt track in 2:01.02 The victory is a record-breaking seventh Derby win for Baffert and the fourth win for Velazquez. They teamed up to win last year’s Run for the Roses with Authentic.<br />“That little horse has a big heart,” Baffert said after the race. “He’s always shown he’s an overachiever.”<br />The official attendance of 51,838 at Churchill Downs on Saturday was the largest crowd at a U.S. sporting event since the pandemic began last year. The previous high of 47,218 was set at Alabama’s spring football game last month. Still, it was far short of a typical Derby crowd of more than 150,000.<br />Medina Spirit is owned by Amr Zedan of Zedan Racing Stables. “I rehearsed this speech in the shower and on the treadmill. I never thought I’d do it but here I am,” Zedan joked in the winner’s circle.”"
