    "body": "Regarding “St. Junipero Serra, Founding Father” (Houses of Worship, May 14): I share James Matthew Wilson’s disgust at the criminal arson of the San Gabriel Mission. The question is how to solve the divisive acrimony that he rightly describes as rampant in our society. How we teach history in our schools is a good part of the answer. Generations of California children have been taught that Native Americans were first introduced to “civilization” by kindly Franciscans. Mr. Wilson says that the San Gabriel Mission was “built to honor God and protect indigenous Americans.”<br />Protect them from what? Indians had lived in freedom for 10,000 years before Junipero Serra. His arrival saw the military subjugation of the tribes, mass death in the pandemic that accompanied the Spanish occupation and the enforced serfdom of free Indians. The tribes lost their languages, culture and traditions.<br />The way the “mission period” is still taught in California schools amounts to an ongoing coverup of the demographic and cultural catastrophes suffered by Native Americans under Spanish rule. Our children deserve to learn the truth about California history and understand the evil consequences of ideas of racial or civilizational superiority. But they can also clearly recognize the blessing they have inherited in this country’s founding principle that all are created equal and all are due equal justice under the law.<br />I have authored legislation to provide for the truthful teaching of California history in our public schools. It is a step toward what Mr. Wilson and I agree on, namely our “hope for a better age to come.”<br />Assemblymember James C. Ramos"
