    "body": "Ford  Motor Co. is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck on Wednesday night, the latest in the push to electrify the auto industry’s global lineups.<br />The auto maker said it would reveal the F-150 Lightning at its headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., at 9:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The vehicle’s production is expected to start next spring at the company’s River Rouge assembly plant near Detroit, Ford said.<br />“F-150 Lightning can power your home during an outage,” Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said. He added that the vehicle would be enhanced “through over-the-air updates.”<br />Even as Ford gets set to unveil the new truck, it is still confronting a chip shortage that had led to reduce shifts and temporary shutdowns at many of its U.S. factories this spring.<br />On Wednesday, Ford said it would idle plants in Michigan and Missouri that make gasoline-versions of the F-150 pickup truck for two weeks starting May 31. It also said it is planning more downtime at several other assembly plants, including its SUV factory in Chicago."
