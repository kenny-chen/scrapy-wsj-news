    "body": "A U.S. federal judge shut down an attempt by Bayer AG to limit all future liability related to its popular Roundup weedkiller, concluding in a Wednesday order that the proposal would benefit the company much more than Roundup users who blame the product for causing cancer.<br />Bayer has said it would pay up to $9.6 billion to settle existing Roundup cases that tie the product to non-Hodgkin lymphoma and another $2 billion toward future claims. The German company lost three trials between 2018 and 2019 brought by Roundup users who said the product caused their cancer and is working to resolve around 125,000 similar claims.<br />The company’s attempt to resolve the future cases came in the form of a novel class-action settlement, which sought to bind people who have used Roundup but aren’t yet sick, as well as Roundup users with cancer who haven’t already sued.<br />In a six-page order, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco pointed to what he called “glaring flaws” in the proposal, including that it offered few benefits for those who haven’t yet gotten sick while forcing them to give up substantial legal rights down the line.<br />Bayer representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment Wednesday."
