    "body": "When Pat Ryan campaigned for Congress in 2018, the West Point graduate got invaluable help from national groups dedicated to supporting veterans running for office.<br />Now, as the Ulster County executive, Mr. Ryan has formed a political-action committee to help nontraditional candidates break into politics. The Democratic executive said in a recent interview that the PAC, called ServeNY, has raised close to $300,000 and would be endorsing Democratic office seekers around New York. It will offer advice and financial assistance to veterans as well as first responders and other essential workers.<br />“People question whether the motivations of their elected officials are self-serving or selfless,” he said. “There needs to be more on-ramps for service-minded people to get into office.”<br />The PAC’s first endorsements will go to Felicia Singh, a special-education teacher running for New York City Council in Queens; Sarah Klee Hood, an Air Force veteran running for town board in the Syracuse suburb of DeWitt; and Anthony Grice, a teacher and Newburgh City Council member who is running for Orange County clerk.<br />The PAC is also a way for Mr. Ryan, a Kingston, N.Y., native, to raise his profile and establish a network of allies beyond his Hudson Valley base. More endorsements are expected in coming weeks, he said."
