    "body": "Missed checkups and physicals. Delayed mammograms and colonoscopies. Many Americans postponed medical appointments for a year during the pandemic and the impact is just beginning to surface, doctors say.<br />“Having a year of uncontrolled diabetes, a year of uncontrolled blood pressure or cholesterol, those are not benign,” says Evelyn Figueroa, a family physician and professor of clinical family and community medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine. “That affects life expectancy.”<br />Studies show patients put off mammograms, pediatric visits and shots for flu, shingles and other maladies. A pandemic-induced delay in screenings could lead to 10,000 breast and colorectal cancer deaths over the next decade, researchers estimate.<br />“These delays potentially have long-term consequences that we still don’t know about,” says Mona Shah, senior program officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which funded two analyses by the Urban Institute looking at healthcare in children and adults under 65. In a survey in September, more than one-third of 4,000 adults said they delayed or didn’t seek care either because they worried about potential exposure to coronavirus or because their healthcare provider was offering limited services.<br />Those more likely to do so were African-American or had a chronic health condition, Ms. Shah says. One-third of people who delayed care said it affected them negatively, by harming their health or limiting their ability to work or do other daily activities."
