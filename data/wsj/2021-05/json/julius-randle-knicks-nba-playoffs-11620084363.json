    "body": "One year ago, the New York Knicks couldn’t win and Julius Randle couldn’t shoot, and there wasn’t much reason to believe that either would change soon.<br />The Knicks had a few decades of ineptitude working against them, and yet the idea of Randle shooting threes dependably was even more fantastical. He was a 29.5% career shooter coming off a season when his 27.7% average made him one of the NBA’s worst 3-point shooters. The statistical evidence to suggest that Randle could suddenly transform himself into a deep threat simply didn’t exist.<br />Anybody looking at Randle and seeing a reliable shooter would have been prescribed glasses. It was like looking at the Knicks and seeing competence.<br />But now something very strange is happening. The Knicks are winning. The Knicks! And they are winning because of another development that appeared so improbable that it seemed impossible: Randle has become one of the NBA’s best 3-point shooters.<br />He is taking more threes—and making way more. His shooting percentage of 42.7% isn’t just good for Randle or someone on the Knicks. It’s good for anybody on earth. Of the roughly 100 players averaging more than five 3-point attempts per game, only seven have a higher percentage than Randle, including Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. Almost none of those 100 players came into the season with a lower career 3-point percentage."
