    "body": "Regarding “In Israel, the Violent Legacy of 1948” (Review, May 22): The Journal has waded into a scholars’ mine field. Historians on all sides of this dispute accuse one another of grave inaccuracies and distortions.<br />Benny Morris presents a version of the events of 1947-48 that may be near the middle of the debate but isn’t in any way a consensus view. He represents a specific school of thought on this issue, usually referred to as the “New Historians,” that emerged in the 1980s. This school claims to give a more accurate account than the “traditional” Israeli one, which says that most of the Arabs who fled did so under pressure from Arab military leaders, who wanted to clear the field for a war of elimination against the Jews, and who promised the departing Arab civilians that they would be back in their homes within a few weeks.<br />But this traditional account is still far from being definitely disproved, as shown by the work of such scholars as Efraim Karsh. Nor is Prof. Morris free from severe criticism by academics at the other end of the ideological spectrum, such as Ilan Pappé, who argue that he falls far short of presenting a full exposé of Jewish/Israeli war crimes committed during this period.<br />David Hoffman<br />Jerusalem"
