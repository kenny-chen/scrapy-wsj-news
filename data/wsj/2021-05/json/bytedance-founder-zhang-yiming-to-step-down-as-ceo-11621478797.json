    "body": "SINGAPORE—ByteDance Ltd., the owner of popular short-video app TikTok, said Thursday founder and global chief executive officer Zhang Yiming would step down from his role to focus on long-term strategy, and appointed co-founder Liang Rubo to take his place.<br />Mr. Zhang’s departure comes as Chinese tech companies have come under growing pressure from a regulatory crackdown on monopolistic practices, and after the Chinese short-video company was caught in the crosshairs of U.S.-China geopolitical tensions last year.<br />His resignation follows an internal executive shake-up in April when Shou Zi Chew, ByteDance’s chief financial officer, was named CEO of TikTok.<br />ByteDance, which counts the  Carlyle Group  and Sequoia Capital among its backers, is one of China’s most valuable startups. Mr. Liang is the head of human resources and management at ByteDance. A graduate of Nankai University, the same college that Mr. Zhang attended, he also founded a different startup with Mr. Zhang before they started ByteDance together in 2012.<br />“I believe I can best challenge the limits of what the company can achieve over the next decade, and drive innovation, by drawing on my strengths of highly-focused learning, systematic thought, and a willingness to attempt new things,” Mr. Zhang said in a letter to employees on Thursday, posted online by the company."
