    "body": "With more than 40% of all U.S. adults fully vaccinated and the daily number of new Covid-19 cases declining, governors across the U.S. are broadly rolling back restrictions implemented during the pandemic.<br />On Monday, governors from New York and New Jersey said their states would on May 19 lift most capacity restrictions at places of business.<br />Neighboring Connecticut previously ended many capacity restrictions and announced in April that it would end all restrictions on businesses beginning May 19, except for indoor masking requirements. On Monday, Connecticut became the first state in the U.S. to have 50% of its adults fully vaccinated, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />Outdoor and indoor gathering limits are also being adjusted upward, said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, while businesses, including Broadway theaters, museums, offices and retailers can now make their own decisions on reopening plans.<br />“The key is smart reopening. Reopening is not a light switch,” said Mr. Cuomo."
