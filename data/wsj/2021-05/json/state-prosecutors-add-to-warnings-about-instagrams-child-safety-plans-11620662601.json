In April, Democratic lawmakers also sent Mr. Zuckerberg a letter criticizing the plan.<br />Facebook now prohibits children under the age of 13 from joining its apps and websites, but Mr. Zuckerberg has acknowledged that many children join by lying about their age.<br />A Facebook spokesman said Monday that the company would work with regulators and lawmakers as its plans for the Instagram children’s version evolve.
