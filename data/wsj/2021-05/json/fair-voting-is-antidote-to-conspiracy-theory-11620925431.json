    "body": "Andy Kessler’s comments in “No Thanks for the Feedback” (Inside View, April 26) are interesting, but I felt disrespected when he started in on election fraud, naming people like me conspiracy theorists. My experience with voter intimidation goes back many years. When I went to register to vote in my new state I was told to register as a Democrat if I wanted a job in the public school to which I had applied. During the Obama years the group Acorn “registered” my college-age daughter. When she showed up at her precinct to vote they told her she wasn’t registered and therefore couldn’t vote. Do you think maybe Acorn “lost” her registration because she registered as a Republican? I am sure many Republicans and Trump supporters have had or heard of similar experiences, so hearing about vote fraud from the man we respect for exposing the left’s tactics was easy to believe and act on.<br />Claudia Trine<br />Henrico, Va."
