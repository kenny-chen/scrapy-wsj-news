    "body": "Around 8,000 migrants illegally entered Ceuta, a Spanish swath of territory bordering Morocco on the North African coast, beginning on Monday, taking Spanish authorities by surprise.<br />Spain sent in the army and more police forces to tighten border controls and then began a mass expulsion of those who entered, among them families and minors.<br />The influx happened at a time of heightened tensions between Spain and Morocco over the Spanish governmentâ€™s decision to allow the leader of a northern African independence group to seek treatment for Covid-19 in Spain.<br />Many migrants from Africa try to reach Europe by the same route in search of a better life, although the number of migrants this week was unusually high.<br />Most of the migrants were young men, but Spanish authorities said they also included families and some unaccompanied minors. The most were Moroccans. The migrants entered illegally by sea, either swimming or using small boats to navigate around a breakwater that marks the border between Spanish Ceuta and Morocco."
