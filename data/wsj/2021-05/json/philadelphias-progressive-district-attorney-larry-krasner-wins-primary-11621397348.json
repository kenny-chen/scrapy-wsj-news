    "body": "Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, one of the highest-profile progressive prosecutors in the U.S., has won the Democratic primary election, according to the Associated Press, putting him in strong position to gain a second four-year term.<br />Mr. Krasner defeated Carlos Vega, a former prosecutor backed by the local police union and whom Mr. Krasner fired shortly after his tenure began in 2018. He will face defense attorney Chuck Peruto in the Nov. 2 general election.<br />The Democratic candidate for this position often wins the general, with registered Democrats in the city outnumbering Republicans seven to one.<br />Mr. Krasner, 60 years old, is among a wave of progressive prosecutors elected in recent years with a platform of reducing prosecutions for low-level crimes, changing bail conditions and opposition to the death penalty. His win could serve as an early gauge of their support, as cities nationwide grapple with an increase in murders and shootings.<br />Tuesday’s election was seen as a test of local attitudes toward Mr. Krasner’s reformist policies at a time of soaring homicide and shooting levels in the nation’s sixth-largest city. Philadelphia had 499 homicides last year, the second-highest total on record, and this year has recorded 197 killings through Monday, a 41% increase from the same point in 2020, police figures show."
