    "body": "Regarding “The Majestic Bald Eagle Is Back—And Wants to Eat Your Little Dog” (Page One, May 15): Pets aren’t at great risk from eagles or other birds of prey. An emaciated bird will sometimes go for a small pet, but because it poses such a large risk to the raptor, this is a rare occurrence. Bald eagles are capable of carrying only about a third of their body weight, meaning a 12-pound eagle can carry 3 to 4 pounds. In the mainland U.S., a decent-size female eagle would be around 12-pounds, while a male would tip the scales closer to 10 pounds.<br />This article could incite fear about eagles, which could lead to retaliation against the birds. I work in wildlife rehabilitation as well as raptor education. This article only makes our job educating people more difficult, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see an increasing number of raptors being shot.<br />Brian Schug<br />Cascades Raptor Center<br />Eugene, Ore."
