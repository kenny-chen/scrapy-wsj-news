    "body": "When Covid-19 vaccines first arrived at health departments around the country, officials took to calling the shots liquid gold in a plea to prevent doses from going unused or being wasted.<br />Now that supplies are ample and the eager are dwindling, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new guidance. Sites should not miss an opportunity to vaccinate an individual, even if it means remaining doses in a vial will go to waste, the CDC said late Thursday.<br />“As access to Covid-19 vaccine increases, it is important for providers to not miss any opportunity to vaccinate every eligible person who presents at vaccine clinics,” the new CDC guidance said.<br />Many health workers and state officials had already been saying that vaccinating people should be the priority over ensuring every dose in an open vial is used.<br />“If you have someone in front of you who needs a vaccine, go ahead and use what you’ve got and try to use it as best you can and as efficiently as you can. But we know that we’re at a point where there will be some wastage that is unavoidable. We’ve got to get people vaccinated now,” said Thomas Dobbs, state health officer for Mississippi."
