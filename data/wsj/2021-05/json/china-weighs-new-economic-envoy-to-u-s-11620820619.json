    "body": "Beijing is considering whether to replace Vice Premier Liu He as its top economic envoy with Washington, according to officials with knowledge of the matter, a decision that Biden administration officials say will indicate the depth of China’s interest in economic cooperation.<br />Under this scenario, these officials said, Mr. Liu, who has spent decades working on economic issues, would be succeeded by Hu Chunhua, a younger vice premier who made his mark overseeing the restive Tibet region and running the trade-reliant coastal province of Guangdong but who has little experience in U.S.-China relations.<br />The deliberation is part of a wider personnel shuffle as China recalibrates its approach to the new U.S. administration. A trade truce reached by both sides early last year has led Beijing to shift its economic focus from tariffs to pressing for the relaxation of sanctions against Chinese companies, especially telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.<br />No final personnel decisions have been made, said the officials, who added that there are also reasons to keep Mr. Liu in this role. China’s Foreign Ministry referred questions to China’s Commerce Ministry, which oversees trade. It didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br />Even if he is replaced as Beijing’s principal economic interlocutor with Washington, Mr. Liu would still have significant responsibility, according to the officials, including oversight of China’s financial sector at a time of heightened debt and default risk."
