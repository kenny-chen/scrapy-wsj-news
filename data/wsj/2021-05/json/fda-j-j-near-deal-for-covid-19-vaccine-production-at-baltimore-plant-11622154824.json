    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Food and Drug Administration and vaccine maker  Johnson & Johnson  expect to announce as early as Friday that contamination problems at a Covid-19 vaccine plant in Baltimore are resolved, clearing the way for millions more doses to become available.<br />Vaccine production at the plant run by contract manufacturer  Emergent BioSolutions Inc.  was halted after unsanitary conditions led to contamination of J&J vaccines. The facility made vaccine substance and finished vaccine doses for J&J and  AstraZeneca  PLC.<br />Emergent chief executive Robert Kramer told a House committee last week that the company had produced enough of a key ingredient to yield more than 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine.<br />The company has been taking corrective measures and been in talks with FDA and J&J over the steps needed to reopen the facility.<br />Johnson & Johnson said it is working with Emergent to secure “as quickly as possible emergency-use-authorization in the U.S. for Covid-19 drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview.”"
