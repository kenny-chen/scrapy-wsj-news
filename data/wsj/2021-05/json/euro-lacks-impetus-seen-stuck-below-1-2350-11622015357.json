    "body": "0831 GMT - The dollar should stay weak as U.S. Federal Reserve officials point to the “transitory nature” of the recent rise in inflation and give markets little reason to anticipate “any imminent and meaningful Fed policy normalization,” ING analysts say. A recovery in economies outside of the U.S. is likely to weigh further on the U.S. currency. “With the recovering global economy and signs of a more synchronized growth outlook, this is not an environment where the dollar would flourish, particularly when facing an ultra-negative real rate,” ING says. The DXY dollar index is last up 0.1% at 89.7260, having on Tuesday dropped to its lowest since early January at 89.5350. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com)"
