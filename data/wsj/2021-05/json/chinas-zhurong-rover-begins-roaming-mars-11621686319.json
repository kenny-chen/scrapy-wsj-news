    "body": "HONG KONG—China’s Zhurong rover set its wheels on the surface of Mars early Saturday, beginning a tour of the red planet that is expected to last 90 days.<br />The rover roamed on Martian soil at approximately 10:40 a.m. Beijing time, according to the China National Space Administration, which released images of Zhurong leaving its landing platform. Six feet tall and weighing about 530 pounds, Zhurong joins the U.S. rover Perseverance on Mars.<br />China’s space program reached a historic milestone a week ago when it landed the rover on Mars from its Tianwen-1 mission on its first try. Zhurong, equipped with scientific instruments such as terrain cameras and particle analyzers, will investigate the planet’s soil, minerals and atmosphere while looking for signs of subsurface water ice.<br />A six-wheeled solar-powered rover, Zhurong is smaller and less technologically advanced that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s nuclear-powered Perseverance, which landed on Mars in February.<br />China is the second country to successfully operate a rover on Mars after the U.S., which first did so in 1997."
