    "body": "Former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, in a speech Thursday evening at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California, plans to argue that the future of the GOP needs to be about more than former President Donald Trump.<br />“Once again, we conservatives find ourselves at a crossroads,” Mr. Ryan will say, according to excerpts shared in advance. “Here’s one reality we have to face: if the conservative cause depends on the populist appeal of one personality, or on second-rate imitations, then we’re not going anywhere.”<br />The party’s 2012 vice-presidential nominee has had a tense relationship with Mr. Trump. In 2019, the then-president said the former speaker was a failure whose “record of achievement was atrocious.”<br />Mr. Ryan is also expected to praise some of the former president’s accomplishments. He plans to say that voters are seeking GOP leaders willing to show “independence and mettle.”<br />The former speaker is the first in a series of Republicans invited to the library, which reopened this week after more than a year of closure because of the Covid-19 pandemic, to discuss the party’s future."
