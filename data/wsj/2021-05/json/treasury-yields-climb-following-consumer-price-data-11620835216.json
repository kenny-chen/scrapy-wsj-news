    "body": "U.S. government bond yields posted their biggest one-day climb in almost two months Wednesday after new data showed consumer prices surged in April, a sign that the economic recovery is still picking up steam.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note finished the session at 1.693%, according to Tradeweb, up from 1.623% at Tuesday’s close. That marks the largest single-session gain since March 18.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, shot up after the Labor Department reported its consumer-price index jumped 4.2% in April from a year earlier—the highest 12-month level since the summer of 2008—due to supply bottlenecks and surging demand as the coronavirus pandemic eased.<br />Rising consumer prices worry bondholders because inflation erodes the value of bonds’ fixed payments and can lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.<br />Analysts and investors are parsing through April’s data to gauge the extent of what many expect to be a monthslong rise in prices. Some believe that faster-than-expected growth and inflation, fueled by the distribution of stimulus money and vaccines, may force the Fed to tighten its easy-money policies, which have included holding interest rates near zero and buying billions of dollars worth of bonds."
