    "body": "Lenders to  Revlon Inc.  that received roughly $500 million from  Citigroup Inc.  last year due to a back-office blunder are allowed to use the money as they see fit, a federal judge ruled Wednesday, unfreezing the funds.<br />Judge Jesse Furman of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Wednesday denied Citi’s request to continue to freeze the funds while the bank tries to persuade an appellate court it deserves the money back. The judge had frozen the funds in August while he considered the case.<br />Citi wanted the freeze to be maintained, saying it feared that even if it won on appeal, it might have difficulty recovering the money once the asset managers distributed it to their clients.<br />The dispute stems from a mistake in August in which Citi paid off—with its own money—a nearly $900 million loan balance owed by Revlon, when only an interest payment was due. When Citi asked for the money back, some of the recipients obliged, returning roughly $385 million.<br />Others—including Brigade Capital Management LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC and HPS Investment Partners LLC—declined to return more than $500 million, touching off a legal dispute with the bank."
