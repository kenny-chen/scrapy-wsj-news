    "body": "A cease-fire between Israel and militant group Hamas was holding for a second day on Saturday, as more residents in Gaza emerged from their homes to survey the damage caused by Israeli airstrikes and foreign aid began trickling into the isolated strip of land.<br />On Al-Wahda Street, where Israeli bombing caused the deaths of more than 40 Palestinians on May 16, every third building was leveled or damaged. The barrages from both sides were the worst since the most recent of three wars between Israel and Hamas in 2014.<br />“Thank god we are still alive, I was totally afraid about my business,” said Hamdi Nabhan, 28, who opened his sweets shop, Carmela, days before the conflict began. He said he saved $20,000 over three years to open the bubblegum-pink-and-white store, which is situated a few blocks from Al-Wahda Street, with freshly painted white walls cracked slightly from the impact of bombs. “There were some rumors the building next to us was going to be destroyed.”<br />In total, thousands of buildings were damaged across the Gaza Strip, displacing at least 65,000 Palestinians to shelters, according to the United Nations and Palestinian authorities.<br />The cessation of hostilities offers a critical window to deliver aid to the densely populated enclave, where overwhelmed hospitals have been tending to injured Palestinians while dealing with shortages of electricity and medical supplies."
