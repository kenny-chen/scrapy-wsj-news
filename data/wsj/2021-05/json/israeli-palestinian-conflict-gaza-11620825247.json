    "body": "Clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police in the contested city of Jerusalem have escalated into a broader conflict, with Israel striking targets in Gaza in response to rockets launched by Palestinian militants. At least 227 people have been killed in Gaza since the escalation began, including 64 children, the Gaza health ministry said. Twelve Israelis, including one child, have also died in the fighting.<br />The confrontation, sparked by tensions old and new, threatens to deepen the region’s turmoil. A full-blown war could force the U.S. to shift attention to the Middle East when it has been focused on Russia, China and battling the coronavirus.<br />Here’s a quick primer on what is going on.<br />Hamas, which rules Gaza, began firing rockets toward Israel after the militant group issued an ultimatum to Israeli police forces to leave the Al Aqsa mosque complex and other areas in the contested city or else face attacks. The cross-border clashes are the worst since the 2014 Gaza war.<br />Some of the first rockets were aimed at Jerusalem, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a red line. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have launched thousands of rockets toward Israel, which has responded with aerial and artillery attacks. Israel says it has killed at least 130 operatives of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group. The operation has exacted a heavy civilian toll."
