    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House was poised to pass a bill Wednesday authorizing a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, but the proposal could stall in the Senate after GOP leaders in Congress and former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to reject it.<br />For the second time in a week, House Republicans found themselves facing a contentious vote that Mr. Trump has framed as a test of their loyalty, even as the party tries to focus on more unifying topics: criticism of the Biden administration and winning next year’s midterm elections.<br />Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) declared his opposition to the House bill earlier Wednesday, joining House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) in dismissing the commission as unnecessary and unfair.<br />Mr. McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor that after careful consideration, he had come to the conclusion that the House bill was a “slanted and unbalanced proposal.” He pointed to other investigations under way by law-enforcement officials and in Congress and said he sees no need for another.<br />Democrats are unified behind the bill, and some Republicans are expected to break with their party leaders and vote to pass it. President Biden also supports the commission, which needs a simple majority in the House and 60 votes to advance in the 50-50 Senate before coming to his desk for his signature."
