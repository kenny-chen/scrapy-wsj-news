    "body": "PARIS—French President Emmanuel Macron’s party has pulled support for a Muslim woman running on its ticket in a local election in June after she wore a head scarf on a campaign poster.<br />The decision sparked a backlash within Mr. Macron’s own party, showing how sensitive the subject of Islam and its place in French society has become for Mr. Macron, who is preparing to mount a bid for reelection next year. His chief rival is Marine Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigrant National Rally party, according to the latest polls.<br />French law doesn’t forbid political candidates from wearing headscarves on public campaign documents, but Stanislas Guérini, the party’s general secretary, said doing so is incompatible with the party’s political line.<br />“Our political movement considers that ostentatious religious symbols have no place on campaign fliers,” Mr. Guérini said in an interview. The party has sent a letter to the candidate and her running mates on Wednesday to inform them of its decision, he added.<br />The candidate, Sara Zemmahi, an engineer who was running to be a deputy council member for the Hérault area in the South of France, didn’t respond to requests for comment."
