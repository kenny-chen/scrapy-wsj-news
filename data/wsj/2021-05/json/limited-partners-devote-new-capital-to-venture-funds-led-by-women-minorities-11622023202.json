    "body": "Venture funds run by women and minority managers are getting a boost from new pools of dedicated capital.<br />Accolade Partners, for one, has raised $200 million to invest in venture funds led by diverse managers, making it one of the largest such efforts to date.<br />“I don’t think you could’ve done this five years ago, but today there’s a critical mass of funds to choose from,” said Joelle Kayden, managing partner and principal owner of Washington, D.C.-based fund-of-funds manager Accolade, which she founded more than two decades ago to invest in venture and growth-equity funds.<br />Ms. Kayden said that Accolade has a database of about 150 firms that would fit its criteria and plans to make about 15 investments over the next two years or so. The firm has already made commitments to venture-capital funds including Acrew Capital, Base10 Partners, Footwork, Leadout Capital and Moxxie Ventures, as well as growth-equity funds such as Biospring Partners and Clearhaven Partners.<br />Accolade’s new fund will be focused on generating returns that outperform the market, Ms. Kayden said, and will aim to demonstrate that diversity enhances outcomes in private markets."
