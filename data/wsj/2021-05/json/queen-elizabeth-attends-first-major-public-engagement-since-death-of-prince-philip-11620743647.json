    "body": "LONDON—Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday undertook her first major public engagement since the funeral of her husband, Prince Philip, announcing her government’s legislative agenda during a pared-back ceremony in Britain’s Parliament.<br />The queen, wearing a light blue hat and day dress instead of the traditional robes and a crown, sat alone in the House of Lords, with the consort’s gilded chair removed for the first time in over a century as she opened Parliament. Prince Philip, the country’s longest-standing royal consort, died last month aged 99.<br />During a ceremony adapted to meet Covid-19 guidelines, ermine-clad members of the House of Lords sat socially distanced in the country’s upper house. The 95-year-old monarch read out a speech that laid out the legislation Boris Johnson’s government intends to put before Parliament.<br />At recent state openings of Parliament, the queen’s eldest son, Prince Charles, sat by her side, as he has done since Prince Philip retired from public duties in 2017. But during this ceremony Prince Charles and his wife sat on chairs off to the side of the stage. The queen traveled to the venue by car rather than by horse and coach.<br />She didn’t wear the Imperial State Crown, a heavy piece of jewelry encrusted with nearly 3,000 precious stones, which instead lay on a pillow by her side as she delivered the speech written for her by the government."
