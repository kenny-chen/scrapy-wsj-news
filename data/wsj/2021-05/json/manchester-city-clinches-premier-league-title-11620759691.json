    "body": "The moment English soccer had expected for months—in the season that felt like it lasted years—finally arrived on Tuesday. Without even kicking a ball, Manchester City clinched its fifth Premier League title in 10 years.<br />The victory, sealed when second-place  Manchester United  lost 2-1 to Leicester City, further confirmed how much this era of English soccer has belonged to the upstarts from Manchester. Fifteen years ago, City wasn’t even the dominant team in its own town. Sitting in the shadow of Manchester United, it changed direction when it was acquired by a half brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 2008.<br />But with the Premier League title secured—and the League Cup in hand as well—it is now in position not only to confirm its place as the dominant club in England—and in Europe. City will aim to win a third trophy this season, the Champions League, when it faces Chelsea in the final on May 29.<br />That said, manager Pep Guardiola insists that this remains his defining achievement, surviving a 38-game grind.<br />“I always said that the Premier League is the most important title,” he said last week."
