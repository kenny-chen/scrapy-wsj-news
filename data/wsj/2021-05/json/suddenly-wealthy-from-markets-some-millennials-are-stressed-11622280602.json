    "body": "Soaring assets and stocks in the past year have in some cases handed midlevel workers huge windfalls.<br />Those who have benefited from the market surge typically fall into one of three categories, said Sahil Vakil, founder of personal-finance tech company MYRA: They were given company shares as compensation and those same shares recently boomed; they caught last year’s retail investing frenzy and rode the market to new highs; or they invested early on in cryptocurrency, to great success.<br />The Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 47% over the past 12 months, and even after a recent pullback, a crypto investor who put $10,000 in  at the end of 2019 could have netted more than $50,000 in gains after bitcoin’s 2020-21 surge.<br />In the past year, more than half of Mr. Vakil’s clients have experienced a market windfall. On the East Coast, Mr. Vakil says his clients typically work in the finance and consulting sectors; on the West Coast, most are working in the tech industry. The average household he works with holds $250,000 in assets and falls between the ages of 25 and 45.<br />Many of these workers may have struggled with stagnating wages and huge student loan debts earlier in their careers. Some worry they’ll mismanage this boon and forever ruin their chance at financial stability."
