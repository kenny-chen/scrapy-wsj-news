    "body": "MEXICO CITY—Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador blasted U.S. funding of a local civil society group critical of his policies as interference in Mexico’s internal affairs, hours before a virtual meeting Friday with Vice President Kamala Harris over immigration.<br />In his morning press conference before the meeting,  Mr. López Obrador said Mexico sent a diplomatic note Thursday to the U.S. demanding an explanation of U.S. funding of Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity, a civic group that has often drawn Mr. López Obrador’s ire for criticizing his policies.<br />The organization has conducted surveys partly funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development.<br />“The financing of the group by the government of the U.S. is an act of  interventionism which violates our sovereignty,” said Mr. López Obrador, who argued that the group is actively involved in Mexican politics.<br />The president said such funding was prohibited by the Mexican Constitution. “It is forbidden to receive money for political purposes. It’s treason.” he added."
