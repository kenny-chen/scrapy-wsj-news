    "body": "The World Health Organization on Friday gave its first endorsement for a Chinese-made Covid-19 vaccine, clearing a shot from the state-owned firm  Sinopharm  for global use.<br />The decision, announced by the international health body after weeks of deliberation, is expected to help alleviate a severe shortage of doses in the developing world, as vaccine exports from Covid-struck India grind to a halt. It will also boost Beijing’s bid to play a leading role in the fight against the pandemic, officials and analysts said.<br />But the doses won’t immediately arrive in the developing world, both because China is facing its own constraints at home, and because Sinopharm currently has no deal in place to supply the WHO’s main effort to distribute doses to lower-income countries.<br />The U.N. agency recommended the vaccine be used immediately, as part of an “emergency use listing,” saying its deployment would help ease acute global shortages. While a handful of wealthy nations have been able to curb the pandemic through mass vaccination campaigns, the world’s poorest nations have been flagging behind, struggling to vaccinate more than a tiny percentage of their populations.<br />“The world needs as many safe and effective vaccines as possible,” said Thomas Bollyky, director of global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “This is good for the world,” he said of WHO’s decision."
