    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden met Tuesday with the family of George Floyd to mark the first anniversary of his killing, as lawmakers in Washington voiced optimism about prospects for police-overhaul legislation despite missing the president’s timeline to pass a bill.<br />Mr. Biden had called on members of Congress to pass legislation aimed at overhauling the policing system by the anniversary of Mr. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody, saying he hoped to mark the occasion by signing a bill into law.<br />Instead, he met privately with Mr. Floyd’s brothers, daughter and other family members, the White House said, five weeks after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, was convicted of three counts, including murder charges, in the death of Mr. Floyd. Three other officers await trial.<br />“To deliver real change, we must have accountability when law enforcement officers violate their oaths,” Mr. Biden said in a statement following the one-hour meeting, which was also attended by Vice President Kamala Harris. “We have to act. We face an inflection point.”<br />Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Mr. Floyd’s family, said Mr. Biden’s message during the meeting was that he wanted to sign “the right bill, not a rushed bill.”"
