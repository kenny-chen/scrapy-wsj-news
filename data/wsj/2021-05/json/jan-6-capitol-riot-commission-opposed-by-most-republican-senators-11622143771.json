    "body": "WASHINGTON—Prospects dimmed for an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, after most Senate Republicans lined up against the proposal at the urging of GOP leaders.<br />The bill will need 60 votes to advance in the evenly divided Senate, thanks to the chamber’s longstanding filibuster rule. That means 10 Republicans would have to vote with all 50 Democrats to allow the bill to proceed. A vote could come later Thursday.<br />Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) declared his opposition to the commission, calling it a political exercise. He suggested that Democrats would weaponize the commission against Republican candidates to keep the controversy over former President Donald Trump’s actions before and during the riot at the forefront of next year’s midterm election campaigns.<br />“The heart of this recommendation by the Democrats is that they would like to continue to debate things that occurred in the past,” Mr. McConnell told reporters earlier this week. “They’d like to continue to litigate the former president into the future.”<br />Democrats could impanel their own special congressional committee to investigate the events surrounding Jan. 6, but party leaders, including President Biden, have said they prefer an independent, bipartisan probe, modeled on the investigation carried out by the 9/11 Commission following the 2001 terrorist strikes."
