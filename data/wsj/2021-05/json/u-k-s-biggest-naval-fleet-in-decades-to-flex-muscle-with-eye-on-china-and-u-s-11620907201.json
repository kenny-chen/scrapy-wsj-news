    "body": "LONDON—The most powerful U.K. fleet to be assembled in decades is preparing to set sail this month on a tour of 40 countries, focused on the Indo-Pacific, in an effort to show British military muscle in a region where the U.S. is seeking to counter Chinese influence.<br />Spearheading the fleet is HMS Queen Elizabeth, one of two new aircraft carriers that are central to the U.K.’s new foreign-policy strategy. The approach seeks to cement the “special relationship” with the U.S. while bolstering alliances within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and across the globe.<br />Britain, now out of the European Union, recently announced an overhaul of its military, pledging the biggest increase in military spending since the Cold War. The U.K. is shrinking its army and cutting its tank forces to spend more on creating a nimbler, better-equipped military with more special forces and drones.<br />“We are all of us light years away from a superpower in scale so don’t have the option of being able to cover all the bases all the time,” U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said.<br />Britain no longer needs a hulking army that can fight a traditional war, he said. Instead, it needs a smaller but better-equipped military force that is deployed abroad helping allies and deterring enemies in contested parts of the globe, he said."
