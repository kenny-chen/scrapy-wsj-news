    "body": "TOKYO—Japanese leaders moved to extend a state of emergency in Tokyo and other major cities for several weeks into June, citing persistently high coronavirus infections with the Summer Olympics set to start in less than two months.<br />Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike asked the central government on Wednesday for the extension beyond the current end date of May 31. Other regional leaders have made similar requests, and the government is expected to make the move official later this week. Local media said the extension is likely to go through June 20, which would be just 33 days before the scheduled day of the Olympic opening ceremony.<br />The latest state of emergency in Tokyo started April 25. Infections have come down but not as quickly as hoped. The U.K. variant known as B.1.1.7, which is considered more contagious, is now dominant in Tokyo, and the variant found in India called B.1.617 has also been detected in Japan. On Wednesday, more than 4,500 new infections were identified.<br />Gov. Koike said of the state of emergency: “Lifting it now would risk a resurgence of infections soon.”<br />The current measures are less restrictive than lockdowns that have been imposed in some parts of the world during the pandemic. Trains operate normally and people can move about freely, but stores selling nonessential goods have been asked to close, and most restaurants are either shutting down at 8 p.m. or closing altogether."
