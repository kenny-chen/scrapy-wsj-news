    "body": "Manhattan prosecutors have convened a special grand jury in their investigation of former President Donald Trump and his company, signaling the office is seeking to bring charges in the case, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The development signals that the office is seeking indictments following a multiyear investigation into the Trump Organization and its officers, former prosecutors said. District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. has said the office is investigating possible bank, tax or insurance fraud.<br />Special grand juries typically sit for at least several months, compared with regular grand juries that are impaneled for a month. They often hear multiple complex cases, such as white-collar investigations.<br />“Special grand juries are common when state prosecutors get to the point where they are ready to seek an indictment but the evidence is too complex or lengthy to present during the normal four-week term,” said Daniel R. Alonso, a former federal prosecutor who was Mr. Vance’s former chief assistant.<br />The special grand jury was earlier reported by the Washington Post."
