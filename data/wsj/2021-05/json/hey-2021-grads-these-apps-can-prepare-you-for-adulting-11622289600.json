    "body": "After Hannah Semmes graduated from college last year and began her first full-time job at a healthcare consulting firm, the 22-year-old found herself overwhelmed with all of the new decisions she had to make.<br />She wasn’t sure which credit card to get, how to find an apartment in New York and whether to invest part of her new salary in a 401(k) or an IRA—or what the difference between them even was.<br />“I was definitely ready to make decisions and I really wanted that independence, but I wanted to make the right decisions,” said Ms. Semmes. “Whenever I have questions, I google what I’m trying to find out and I usually have 12 different tabs open and I get distracted. I try to glean a couple of facts to take away, but it’s time-consuming.”<br />Each year, thousands of college students are thrust into the real world with little or no preparation for its many decisions. They often have to find apartments in new cities. And if they’re lucky enough to have a job that offers benefits, they suddenly have to figure out which health and retirement options to choose.<br />While each generation has its own struggles with coming of age, this generation is facing record levels of student debt and an uncertain job market."
