    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Republicans ousted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming from their leadership ranks in a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning, according to GOP aides, in an effort by the party to extinguish the most visible fight over former President Donald Trump and his role in the party’s future.<br />She was removed in a voice vote, the aides said.<br />Ms. Cheney, the House GOP’s most prominent critic of Mr. Trump, had clashed publicly with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) and other senior Republicans by pushing back on Mr. Trump’s baseless claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him.<br />GOP lawmakers said the public struggle put Ms. Cheney out of step with the majority of House Republicans, who wanted to avoid disputes over Mr. Trump’s comments and actions surrounding the 2020 election and focus on regaining the House majority in next year’s midterm elections.<br />“When you’re in leadership, you represent the entire conference,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R., Idaho). “You can have your own views, but eventually you got to remember you represent the entire conference and that’s been the challenge with her.”"
