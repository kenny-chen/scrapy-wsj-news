    "body": "WASHINGTON—The leaders of the House committee on Homeland Security have struck a bipartisan deal to create an independent commission investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, but top congressional Republicans didn’t immediately endorse the proposal.<br />The chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, Bennie G. Thompson (D., Miss.), said Friday that he had reached an agreement with the panel’s top-ranking Republican, Rep. John Katko (R., N.Y.), to introduce legislation to form the commission, with a vote expected as early as next week.<br />“Inaction—or just moving on—is simply not an option,” Mr. Thompson said of the agreement, reached after months of negotiations.<br />Mr. Katko said the commission “is about facts, not partisan politics.”<br />The New York lawmaker was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump for inciting insurrection against the U.S. government on Jan. 6, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol to try to stop lawmakers from ratifying President Biden’s electoral college victory. Mr. Trump was acquitted by the Senate in February."
