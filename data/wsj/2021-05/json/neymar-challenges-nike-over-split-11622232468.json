    "body": "Neymar and his father fired back at  Nike Inc.  on Friday, disputing the sportswear giant’s reason for the ending of the soccer star’s endorsement deal and denying a Nike employee’s allegation of a sexual assault.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Nike ended its endorsement deal with the Brazilian superstar after he refused to cooperate with a company investigation into a female employee’s allegation that he had sexually assaulted her during a 2016 publicity tour in New York.<br />“Nike ended its relationship with the athlete because he refused to cooperate in a good faith investigation of credible allegations of wrongdoing by an employee,” said Hilary Krane, Nike’s general counsel, in response to questions from the Journal.<br />Neymar, whose full name is Neymar da Silva Santos Jr., denied the sexual-assault allegation. On Friday, he said Nike’s general counsel had “improperly and irresponsibly” discussed the reason for the termination of the endorsement deal. Neymar said the agreement ended for commercial reasons.<br />“Despite all the reported untruths, we will not present, for the time being, the documents that reveal the form of termination of the contract, for obvious reasons of strict secrecy and confidentiality,” his management company wrote in a message published across the player’s social media accounts."
