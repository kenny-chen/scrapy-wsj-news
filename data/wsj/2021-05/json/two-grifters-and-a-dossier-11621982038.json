    "body": "Like many who ordered Barry Meier’s new book, “Spooked,” I was uninterested in his complaint about corporate spies peddling information to journalists. It still falls to reporters to do their own jobs properly.<br />I wanted to find out what he learned about the origins of the Steele dossier. Mr. Meier, a retired New York Times reporter, does not blow any lids off but he makes it harder not to see that the vital and indispensable element of Christopher Steele’s method—and Glenn Simpson’s method—was flagrant, out-and-out pretense about who Mr. Steele’s sources were.<br />He didn’t have any meaningful sources; the implication that he was tapping a network from his years as a British operative or was actively developing and assessing new sources appears to be entirely misleading. It’s time to say that just asking anybody with a Russian surname to say something bad about Donald Trump and Russia is not the same as developing “intelligence.” Mr. Steele would be better off today reputation-wise if he could claim he was a victim of Kremlin disinformation. At least he could say it took a large and capable national intelligence service to make a fool or worse out of him.<br />Mr. Meier thinks the story here is the nefarious corporate intelligence sector that Mr. Simpson represents; I thought from day one it was about the kind of grifters and wannabes who are always approaching journalists claiming secret knowledge and top-level contacts.<br />Whatever his former employment a decade earlier, that’s what Mr. Steele had become."
