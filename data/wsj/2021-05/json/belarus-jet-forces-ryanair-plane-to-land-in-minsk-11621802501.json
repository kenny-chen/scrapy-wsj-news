    "body": "MOSCOW—Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko scrambled a jet fighter to force a  Ryanair  commercial aircraft to land in Minsk, where a Belarusian journalist and opposition activist was detained. The Sunday incident sparked an international outcry and raised questions over the legality of the plane’s grounding.<br />The aircraft was flying from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, when it was diverted to land in the Belarusian capital.<br />A spokesman for Ryanair said the flight’s crew were notified by Belarus air-traffic control of a potential security threat on board and were instructed to divert to the nearest airport, which was Minsk.<br />A statement on Mr. Lukashenko’s official Telegram messenger app said Belarusian authorities received information that a passenger plane over the country’s airspace possibly had explosives on board and Mr. Lukashenko ordered a MiG-29 jet fighter to escort the aircraft to land in Minsk.<br />Authorities didn’t provide details about the source of the information. Neither Mr. Lukashenko’s office nor Belarus’s Investigative Committee or emergency-services agency immediately responded to requests for comment clarifying the incident, including the chronology of events and exactly what occurred."
