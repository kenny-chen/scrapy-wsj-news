    "body": "Billy Joe Taylor set up a medical testing lab in 2017 in Arkansas, submitting around $23 million in claims to Medicare through early 2020. His billing activities had already left a former business partner uneasy, the partner later told the FBI, but once the pandemic hit the activities appeared to go into overdrive.<br />Mr. Taylor acquired a California lab for $60,000 in February 2020, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit filed last week, and used it to bill more than $42 million in fake claims through last month. Mr. Taylor bundled expensive and unnecessary tests with those coded as Covid-19-related, in an apparent effort to slip them through for approval, the affidavit alleged. The document said $11 million of those claimed were paid.<br />The California lab, Beach Tox, didn’t conduct any tests after Mr. Taylor acquired it, and didn’t have any equipment in the lab to do so after July 2020, the affidavit said, citing the lab equipment’s owner. A lawyer for Mr. Taylor, who was arrested and released Wednesday on bond, said Mr. Taylor would plead not guilty. “There are a significant number of factual inaccuracies in the complaint affidavit that will be addressed as this case proceeds,” the lawyer, Robert Nicholson, said.<br />Mr. Taylor is one of around a dozen people charged by federal prosecutors in the past week with participating in fraud schemes related to the pandemic, as the Justice Department ramps up investigations into misconduct tied to Covid-19 and the trillions of dollars in government relief funds provided since last year. The new cases collectively account for around $143 million in fraudulent bills to government healthcare programs, the agency said.<br />“These medical professionals, corporate executives and others allegedly took advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to line their own pockets instead of providing needed healthcare services during this unprecedented time in our country,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco."
