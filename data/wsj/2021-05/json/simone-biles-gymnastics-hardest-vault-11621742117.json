    "body": "INDIANAPOLIS—Nineteen months after she last competed, Simone Biles has returned to claim the hardest vault in women’s gymnastics history as her reward for the delayed Olympic Games.<br />Biles on Saturday evening became the first female gymnast to perform a “Yurchenko double pike”—a vault that isn’t currently in the women’s rulebook and scoring system, requiring judges to assign it a provisional difficulty value of 6.6.<br />That score would make it the hardest vault that has ever been completed by a woman—though Biles and her coaches continue to believe it should be rated more highly still.<br />Biles powerfully delivered the vault at the 2021 GK U.S. Classic, where it was one of several stunning versions of the move she casually tossed out in warm-ups over the course of the event.<br />Her adrenaline-filled bounce on the landing, for an execution score of 9.5, suggests there is still room for improvement in her next three planned competitions: the U.S. Championships in two weeks, U.S. Olympic team trials at the end of June, and then the Olympic Games scheduled to open in Tokyo on July 23."
