    "body": "Chris Hamilton, his wife Kristin and their three daughters held a memorial service recently for his mother, Rona, who died last year, days after the pandemic-related lockdown began.<br />They picked the weekend of her April 23 birthday and set out chairs for 20 relatives and close friends in the yard of their Broomall, Pa., home. A celebrant officiated. The girls, ages 9, 7 and 6, wrote and read poems about gardening with Nana.<br />Mr. Hamilton, an only child whose father died a decade ago, delivered a eulogy that he had been thinking about for the past 13 months. He had wanted to honor his mother’s life with a gathering, but the pandemic made doing so safely impossible for months. “The guilt and weight on my shoulders for the last year has been lifted,” he says.<br /><br />Across the country, as restrictions ease and vaccinations become more available, families are holding long-delayed memorial services for those who died last year. Some are being held on a loved one’s birthday or the one-year anniversary of a death, often in parks, yards and cemeteries. Such rituals allow people to share pent-up grief, according to David Kessler, who has written six books about grief."
