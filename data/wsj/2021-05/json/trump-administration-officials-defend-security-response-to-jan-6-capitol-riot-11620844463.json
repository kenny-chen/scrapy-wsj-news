    "body": "Two former senior Trump administration officials defended their efforts to help secure the Capitol during the pro-Trump Jan. 6 riot in their first testimony about the attack.<br />Former President Donald Trump’s last acting defense secretary, Christopher Miller, and his acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, both of whom served in those posts for only a few weeks, said on Wednesday they had sent backup security personnel as soon as they understood the gravity of the breach of the Capitol’s perimeter. Mr. Trump’s supporters went on to overrun the Capitol as Congress started to certify President Biden’s Electoral College win.<br />“This isn’t a video game where you can move forces with the flick of a thumb,” Mr. Miller said, testifying before the House oversight panel. He said his actions that day reflected concerns, as expressed by former defense secretaries days earlier, about the military involving itself in election disputes. “Our nation’s armed forces are to be deployed for domestic law enforcement only when all civilian assets are expended, only as the absolute last resort,” he said.<br />Mr. Rosen said he was proud of the Justice Department’s response, noting that he told federal tactical teams to be on standby and deployed hundreds of federal agents after the building was breached. “I think the threat of violence was understood by everybody,” he said.<br />The hearing was part of several continuing inquiries into the riot. The Justice Department has charged more than 400 people with alleged offenses stemming from the attack, which left five people dead. Several government watchdogs and congressional committees are examining a law-enforcement response that experts across the political spectrum have said amounted to one of the biggest lapses since the federal security apparatus was overhauled following the Sept. 11 attacks nearly two decades ago."
