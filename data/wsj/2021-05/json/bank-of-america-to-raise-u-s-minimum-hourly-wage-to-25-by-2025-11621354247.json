    "body": "Bank of America Corp.  on Tuesday said it plans to raise its hourly minimum wage to $25 by 2025, putting it on track to surpass its big-bank peers during a time of worker shortages across the country.<br />The Charlotte, N.C., banking giant also said it is requiring all of its U.S. vendors to pay employees who are dedicated to the bank at least $15 an hour.<br />The second-largest U.S. lender joins companies including  Amazon.com Inc.  and  McDonaldâ€™s Corp.  in saying it will raise pay to attract workers as the economy reopens more fully. Average hourly earnings for private-sector employees rose by 21 cents to $30.17 last month, according to a recent Labor Department report.<br />JPMorgan Chase  & Co., the largest U.S. lender, in January raised its minimum hourly base pay to between $16 and $20, depending on the local cost of living.  Wells Fargo  & Co. last year raised its pay to between $15 and $20 an hour, also depending on geography. And  Citigroup Inc.  raised its base pay to $15 an hour in 2019, though a spokeswoman said its average for hourly U.S. workers is $23.89.<br />In March 2020, Bank of America raised its minimum hourly wage to $20, a year ahead of plan, after boosting it to $17 an hour in 2019. The bank said it has more than doubled its minimum hourly pay since 2010."
