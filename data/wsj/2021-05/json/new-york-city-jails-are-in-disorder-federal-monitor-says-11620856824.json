    "body": "The New York City jail system is in disorder and use of force against inmates is at a five-year high, a court-appointed federal monitor said in a newly published report.<br />The 342-page report said that the rate of use of force in city jails was higher in 2020 than any year since at least 2015, with an average of 11.3 incidents of force per 100 inmates. That figure is 38% higher than the 2019 average rate of 8.2 incidents of force per 100 inmates. Just over half of the incidents had either procedural errors or involved avoidable or problematic force, according to the report.<br />While some use-of-force tactics have been curtailed, the report said, the federal monitor Steve Martin and his team were concerned about the overall state of reform within the city’s Department of Correction, which runs the Rikers Island jail complex and other city detention centers. “The pervasive level of disorder and chaos in the Facilities is alarming,” the report said.<br />Mr. Martin was appointed a monitor to oversee overhaul efforts at city jails as part of a 2015 settlement of a civil-rights lawsuit over alleged abuses at the jail complex.<br />As part of his appointment, Mr. Martin is tasked with producing reports on efforts to improve jail conditions. His latest report, submitted to a federal judge on Tuesday, was the 11th about city jails."
