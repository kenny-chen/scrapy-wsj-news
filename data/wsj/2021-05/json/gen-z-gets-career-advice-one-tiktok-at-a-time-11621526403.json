    "body": "Jackie Cuevas has read a lot of lackluster emails from job seekers. One particularly uninspired entry last May prompted the 30-year-old human-resources manager to take to TikTok.<br />In a 55-second video posted to her account, she explained why the phrase, “Hello, I was wondering if you guys were looking to hire,” isn’t the way to grab a potential employer’s attention. Her video garnered 11,000 views—a lot at the time for Ms. Cuevas, whose previous posts mostly featured her cat or her lip-syncing talents.<br />She now posts career advice multiple times a week as “Jackie, your friend in HR,” fielding questions from nearly 150,000 followers on everything from phone-interview tips to getting a résumé through an applicant-tracking system. In her videos, she often speaks into a tiny rose-gold microphone that has become her trademark.<br />“Of course there’s a career center and counselors, but upon getting closer to the real world, they’re like, ‘I have no idea what I want to do or need to do,’” says Ms. Cuevas of her predominantly 20-something TikTok audience.<br />To the casual observer, TikTok is an app known for animal videos, choreographed dances or those weeks in January when everyone was inexplicably performing sea shanties. Click on #HRTikTok, #careeradvice or even #recruitersbelike, and a universe of career advice—from “How to quit like a pro” to “3 things you never wanna say in an interview” to “Stop saying I’m sorry in the workplace!!”—awaits."
