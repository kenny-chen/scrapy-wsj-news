    "body": "Over the years, the refrain of businesses complaining about how hard it is to find workers has become a bit like the boy who cried wolf. But now the wolf actually may have arrived.<br />He is asking for a fatter paycheck.<br />The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the number of unfilled job openings in the U.S. rose to a record 8.1 million on the last day of March, lifting the job-openings rate—job openings as a percentage of the total number of open and filled jobs—to 5.3% from 5% a month earlier. Before the pandemic, the highest the job-openings rate had ever hit in the 20-year history of the data was 4.8% in 2018.<br />If anything, the job-openings rate is higher now. Data from jobs site Indeed.com show that as of May 7 job postings were a seasonally adjusted 23% above their Feb. 1, 2020, level. That is up from the end of March, when postings were 16% above that pre-pandemic level.<br />Stories about businesses struggling to find workers were a constant feature of the years leading up to the pandemic, but since wage gains were middling throughout that period, they began drawing scoffs. If you really need people so badly, why not pay them more?"
