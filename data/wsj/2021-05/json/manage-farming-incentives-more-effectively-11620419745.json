    "body": "Regarding “Farmers Want Help Cutting Emissions” (U.S. News, May 3): Taxpayer-funded federal programs have certainly helped America’s agricultural sector become one of the most productive and efficient in the world. Now, through expanded adoption of conservation practices, our nation’s farmers have the potential to help reduce global-warming emissions while enhancing crop productivity and profitability.<br />But the biggest obstacle isn’t lack of federal subsidies, it’s too many. Farm bill commodity programs are tied to ownership of land, not implementation of conservation. The federal crop-insurance program charges the same rates for farmers who reduce their risk of loss by adopting conservation practices as it does their neighbors who do not. And “emergency” subsidies for recent hurricanes, Midwestern flooding and bomb cyclone snows came with no requirement that farmers adapt their operations to the new normal of increased weather and market volatility.<br />Congress should make major reforms to agriculture and climate policy. Refocusing spending on conservation adoption can play a role. But real progress on climate takes more than dollars, it also requires change.<br />Joshua Sewell<br />Taxpayers for Common Sense"
