    "body": "When Tali Farhadian Weinstein arrived in Queens at 4 years old after her family fled the Iranian Revolution, she soon learned to sew her own clothes with her mother to save money. By 21, she was a Rhodes scholar and held a top Justice Department position by her early 30s.<br />Now, she is one of eight Democratic contenders seeking to become Manhattan district attorney, drawing on her immigrant roots and meteoric rise in the legal field to center her campaign around reforming the office.<br />“I know what it’s like to be given an opportunity,” said Ms. Farhadian Weinstein. “That motivates me and makes me want others to have opportunity and prosperity, and I think safety is a precondition for all of that.”<br />Her personal story helps to blunt criticism from her opponents that she is the candidate for Manhattan’s most affluent residents. Ms. Farhadian Weinstein, whose husband, Boaz Weinstein, founded hedge fund Saba Capital Management LP, has raised over $2.5 million, more than any other candidate, with hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from the finance sector.<br />Those who know her personally said her wealth is only part of her story."
