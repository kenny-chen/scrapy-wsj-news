    "body": "It’s impossible to know if Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara has become yet another victim of psychiatric torture by the Cuban military dictatorship. But it sure looks that way. The 33-year-old artist has been held incommunicado at Havana’s Calixto Garcia Hospital since May 2.<br />A short, edited video of Mr. Otero Alcántara, released by regime surrogates via social media on May 20, has alarmed friends, supporters and the human-rights community. Amnesty International has declared him a prisoner of conscience. On Wednesday the New York Review of Books ran an open letter from more than 30 artists and writers across the globe demanding his release.<br />Don’t bet on it. This poor Afro-Cuban, armed only with his courage, intellect and creativity, is an existential threat to Cuba’s ruling elite.<br />Mr. Otero Alcántara is a founder of the San Isidro Movement, a collection of Cuban artists, writers, musicians, students and researchers formed in 2018 to oppose regime censorship. He was on a hunger strike to protest state confiscation of his artwork when police carted him off. They wanted to put an end to the public spectacle of his deteriorating physical condition.<br />The dictatorship also may have thought that by “hospitalizing” Mr. Otero Alcántara it would gag the movement—and maybe even get rid of him. (He’s in the same hospital where Ladies in White leader Laura Pollán died in 2011 at the height of her effectiveness as a regime critic.) But rising international criticism suggests the strategy could backfire."
