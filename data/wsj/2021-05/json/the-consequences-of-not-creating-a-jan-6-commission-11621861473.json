    "body": "Arriving at the right answer often starts with asking the right question. That rule is worth pondering as the Senate this week considers whether to approve creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the ransacking of the Capitol by an angry mob of Trump supporters on Jan. 6.<br />The main question that will be debated is: What will happen if such a panel is created?<br />The better question may be: What will happen if one isn’t?<br />For starters, there will be plenty of inquiries into the events of Jan. 6 anyway. Dozens of trials of those who entered the Capitol will unfold, producing a lot of new information and detail. Congressional committees, operating in a typically partisan fashion, will continue to call witnesses, hold public hearings and issue reports. Journalistic inquiries will continue.<br />But here’s one other consequence if Washington chooses to move down the road without such a commission: The political system will have shown that it remains incapable of reversing the very problems that produced the violence in the first place—severe partisanship, rampant mistrust of the other side, a new willingness to question election results."
