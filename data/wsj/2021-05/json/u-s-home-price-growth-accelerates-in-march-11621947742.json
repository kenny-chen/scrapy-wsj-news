    "body": "Home-price growth climbed in March to the highest level in more than 15 years, as strong demand continued to outweigh the housing supply.<br />The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 13.2% in the year that ended in March, up from an 12% annual rate the prior month. March marked the highest annual rate of price growth since December 2005.<br />Robust homebuying demand, driven by ultralow mortgage interest rates, and a shortage of homes for sale have pushed prices rapidly higher in recent months. There were 1.07 million homes on the market at the end of March, down 28.2% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.<br />There are early indications that home sales are slowing, but economists expect the supply-demand imbalance to continue driving prices up. Fast-rising home prices and the limited inventory are making homeownership less attainable for first-time buyers or those with limited budgets.<br />The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 12.8% over the year ended in March, compared with a 11.7% increase in February. The 20-city index rose 13.3%, after an annual gain of 12% in February. Price growth accelerated in all 20 cities."
