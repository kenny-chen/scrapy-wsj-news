    "body": "WASHINGTON—An increasingly vocal progressive wing is putting more pressure on Democratic leaders over hot-button issues including U.S. military aid to Israel, Capitol security funding and policing practices.<br />Democrats will need to remain united to pass President Biden’s agenda through their narrow majorities in Congress, including trillions of dollars in proposed infrastructure and education spending. But after largely standing with the party at the start of the administration, progressives have asserted themselves, spurred by the fighting between Israel and Hamas and the continued national debate over race and policing. That is creating headaches for other Democrats but also showing the limits of their power.<br />A central point of contention is Israel, with progressives denouncing Israeli airstrikes in Gaza for their toll on Palestinian civilians. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) is trying to force a vote on a resolution aimed at halting a $735 million weapons sale to Israel, questioning whether U.S. military aid was helping to keep the peace in the region or fueling conflict.<br />“At a moment when U.S.-made bombs are devastating Gaza and killing women and children, we cannot simply let another huge arms sale go through without even a congressional debate,” Mr. Sanders said.<br />Republicans and other Democrats have largely backed the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Israel has a right to defend itself. On Friday, President Biden played down party divisions and said he remained a staunch supporter of Israel."
