    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department and a House committee reached an agreement that will allow former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn to offer testimony about events described in special counsel Robert Mueller’s 2019 Russia report.<br />Wednesday’s agreement, detailed in a court filing to the Washington, D.C., federal appeals court, sidesteps a messy legal fight that could have reshaped relations between the executive branch and Congress.<br />Democrats who run the Judiciary Committee have sought Mr. McGahn’s testimony for two years as part of an investigation of potential obstruction of justice by then-President Donald Trump during Mr. Mueller’s Russia investigation.<br />The agreement, which comes months after the Biden administration assumed control of the Justice Department, limits Mr. McGahn’s testimony to a closed-door transcribed interview with the committee to be scheduled as soon as possible. He will be permitted to testify about matters referenced in the public portion of Mr. Mueller’s report. A transcript may be released publicly, according to the agreement.<br />Neither Mr. McGahn nor an attorney representing him responded to a request for comment. The Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment."
