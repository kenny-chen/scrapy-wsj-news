    "body": "WASHINGTON—Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) said Republicans who ignored former President Donald Trump’s continuing false claims of a stolen election were undermining democracy, in a defiant speech on the House floor on the eve of a vote expected to oust her from the House GOP’s top ranks.<br />House Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday morning to remove her as chairwoman of the House GOP conference, after weeks of tension between Ms. Cheney and other party leaders over Mr. Trump’s role in inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol and his future in leading the Republican Party. GOP leaders have emphasized party unity, including with Mr. Trump, while Ms. Cheney has insisted that the GOP cut ties with the former president.<br />“Remaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar,” Ms. Cheney said on the House floor Tuesday evening. “I will not participate in that. I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former president’s crusade to undermine our democracy.”<br />Mr. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House earlier this year over actions related to the riot, in which his supporters stormed the Capitol building as Congress was gathered to formalize Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Mr. Trump was acquitted in the Senate.<br />Mr. Trump has claimed that the election was stolen from him, and he has continued to make unfounded allegations after Mr. Biden took office. In a statement Tuesday, he said the election was “rigged and stolen from us.”"
