    "body": "JetBlue  Airways Corp. founder David Neeleman is making another bet on the U.S. airline business as travel bounces back from the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Breeze Airways, Mr. Neeleman’s fifth airline startup, said Friday it will focus on nonstop flights between midsize cities—routes where rival airlines are largely absent—starting at the end of the month.<br />The upstart airline is flying into an increasingly crowded marketplace. Avelo Airlines, another new carrier operating in the Western U.S., has already attracted competition from other airlines on some routes. Established airlines, flush with cash from investors and government aid, have indicated they don’t plan to cede market share to new entrants as they have in previous rocky periods.<br />In past downturns, “the big airlines would push back from the table and leave the scraps for all the startups,” Scott Kirby, chief executive of United Airlines Holdings Inc., said at a Bloomberg Live event earlier this week. “I can tell you at United Airlines, we’re going to do the opposite.”<br />Mr. Neeleman had hoped Breeze would begin flying in 2020 until the pandemic decimated demand for air travel and forced him to delay his plans and seek outside investments."
