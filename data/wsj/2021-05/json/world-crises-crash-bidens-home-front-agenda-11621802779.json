    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden went to Michigan last week to promote American autos, only to be greeted by Arab-Americans protesting his Middle East policies, in the latest instance in which a foreign-policy crisis has impinged on the home-front issues at the top of his agenda.<br />Time and again this year, as Mr. Biden has focused on what he considers an all-important domestic agenda, he has faced emerging problems overseas: Russia’s troop buildup near Ukraine, confrontation with Chinese diplomats, an explosive virus surge in India.<br />Last week saw a cease-fire in an 11-day crisis in the Middle East in which war broke out between the Israelis and Palestinians, overshadowing Mr. Biden’s schedule and distracting from a series of preplanned events.<br />Mr. Biden has pursued the most progressive domestic-policy program in generations, including trillions of dollars in spending on infrastructure, education and child care, while tackling the pandemic.<br />White House officials have long said they wanted to give priority to domestic issues to ensure the country is strong enough to lead overseas. A former U.S. official with close contact to the administration said that the calculation was to put a hold on intensive global engagement until the administration could bolster the economy and address the pandemic."
