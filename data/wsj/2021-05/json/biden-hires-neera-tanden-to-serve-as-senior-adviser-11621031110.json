    "body": "WASHINGTON—Neera Tanden, who withdrew her nomination to serve as President Biden’s budget director amid opposition in Congress, will serve as a senior adviser to the president, the White House said Friday.<br />White House officials said Ms. Tanden, a veteran policy aide who would have been the first woman of color and first South Asian woman to lead the Office of Management and Budget, will instead take on a role involving healthcare and internet access. The position doesn’t require Senate confirmation.<br />The officials said Ms. Tanden will be responsible for preparing for various contingencies that could arise from the Supreme Court’s consideration of Republican lawsuits aimed at undoing the Affordable Care Act. The Biden administration has argued that the Obamacare law is constitutional and a decision on the case, which was argued in November, is pending before the court.<br />Ms. Tanden also will review the United States Digital Service, which seeks to make the federal government more accessible to people online, the officials said.<br />Ms. Tanden’s nomination was withdrawn in March after Senate Republicans and a key Senate Democrat opposed her nomination over past social-media comments, which included criticism of senators. The White House said after the withdrawal that it planned to find a position for her that didn’t require Senate approval."
