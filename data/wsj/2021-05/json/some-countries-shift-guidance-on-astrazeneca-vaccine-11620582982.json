    "body": "Several countries have shifted their guidance in recent days on who should receive the  AstraZeneca  PLC vaccine, as public-health officials continue to weigh the risk of the vaccine against the prevalence of Covid-19 cases.<br />The AstraZeneca shot hasn’t been cleared for use in the U.S., unlike Covid-19 vaccines from  Pfizer Inc.,   Moderna Inc.  and  Johnson & Johnson .  But in some wealthy countries where the supply of those vaccines has been more constrained, AstraZeneca doses have been offered to people as young as 30, showing the wide variation even among wealthy countries in vaccination campaigns.<br />On Friday, the U.K.’s vaccines advisory body said the vaccine produced by AstraZeneca, which has raised concerns among health experts due its possible link to rare blood clots, should preferably not be given to people under 40. Previous guidance suggested the vaccine should preferably not be given to people under 30.<br />In Canada last week, members of a national expert panel referred to the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna as the preferred option after elected officials had earlier encouraged citizens to get the first vaccine available, which for some age groups was AstraZeneca’s shot.<br />Meanwhile, German officials on Thursday took the opposite tack, saying they would make the vaccine available to all adults after earlier limiting it to those 60 years and older, as it sought to speed up a vaccination campaign that had gotten off to a slow start."
