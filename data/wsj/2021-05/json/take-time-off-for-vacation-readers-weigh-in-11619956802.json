    "body": "As vaccination rates continue to soar, many Americans are contemplating vacations. But over a year into the pandemic and working from home, many people have found detaching from work harder than ever. In response to Rachel Feintzeig’s recent column on the topic, many readers shared their own experiences. Below is a lightly edited sampling of their comments.<br /><br />I work for HP. Last year, the entire company shut down for one week in August in addition to the annual two-week Christmas shutdown. The beauty is that everyone in the company is off. Minimal emails, no work expected to be done, just relax. By taking the time off, you don’t miss out on much. I normally get between 50 to 300 emails per day. During shutdown, it’s down to five or less. All the newcomers to the company see this value and comment on how relaxing the time off can be, even without travel, and no huge backlog of work to return to.<br />More companies should try it. It does wonders, and the forced shutdown requires the use of vacation days.<br />—Thomas Wittenberg"
