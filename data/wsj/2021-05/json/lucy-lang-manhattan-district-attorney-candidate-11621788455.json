    "body": "As a Manhattan prosecutor in 2017, Lucy Lang secured murder convictions against two masked shooters who opened fire on a crowded street, killing Yvonne Graham’s 28-year-old son.<br />The morning after the verdict, Ms. Graham told Ms. Lang that she had slept all night for the first time since her son died—but that when she woke up, she was worried about the mothers of the two young men going to prison.<br />“I lost my son to the streets, and they lost their sons to the criminal-justice system,” Ms. Graham said in an interview last week. “There’s no winning here.”<br />Ms. Lang said her experience with Ms. Graham and others directly affected by law enforcement has informed her campaign to lead the Manhattan district attorney’s office. She has pledged to take seriously the perspectives of crime victims, offenders and their families.<br />Ms. Lang, 40 years old, has emerged from the field of eight Democratic candidates as a problem solver with prosecutorial skills, laying out a series of ideas that she said will make prosecutions fairer and more equitable. Her plans are drawn from more than 12 years in the Manhattan office and two years at a criminal-justice organization where she gained national attention as a policy expert advising prosecutors across the country."
