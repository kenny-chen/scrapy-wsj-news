    "body": "Despite a commodity boom that is boosting profits, miners aren’t throwing cash at new projects, raising concerns about future shortages of some metals.<br />So-called technology metals, such as cobalt, copper and lithium, are set for particularly large deficits, analysts say, amid rising demand from makers of batteries, electric cars and wind turbines. Supply constraints threaten to slow countries’ plans to reduce emissions and make them more expensive, they say.<br />Though off their highs, many mined commodities have hit record prices this year as the global economy bounces back from Covid-19, governments increase spending on infrastructure and supply stutters for some resources. For instance, the price of copper—used in construction and to conduct electricity—has almost doubled over the past 12 months to a record of $10,762 a metric ton earlier this month.<br />But miners have been reluctant to invest in new projects, analysts and executives say, because their investors have in recent years wanted higher dividends after seeing the sector burn through cash during the last commodity bull run. That hesitancy is now raising the specter of supply crunches.<br />“We are starting to see some pinch points appear in the key energy-transition metals, copper and platinum group metals for example, where there is very little new supply ready to fill the gap,” says  Anglo American  PLC Chief Financial Officer Stephen Pearce."
