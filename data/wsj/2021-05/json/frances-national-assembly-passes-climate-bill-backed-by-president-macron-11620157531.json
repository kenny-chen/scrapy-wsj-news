    "body": "PARIS—France’s National Assembly on Tuesday approved a bill backed by President Emmanuel Macron to cut greenhouse gas emissions, over objections from opposition lawmakers and environmental groups who said it would leave the country short of meeting targets under the Paris climate accord.<br />Mr. Macron has been one of the most vocal defenders on the global stage of the Paris deal, which was signed in the French capital a year-and-a-half before he was elected president in 2017. But at home he is under pressure to bring France in line with the European Union’s plan to achieve the bloc’s Paris accord commitment: a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990.<br />Mr. Macron in 2019 backed off a plan to raise carbon taxes on energy after the idea sparked the antiestablishment yellow vest movement. That threw off France’s plans to hit its EU commitment on emissions.<br />“The yellow vest movement reminded us how crucial public acceptance is,” Marie Lebec, a lawmaker from Mr. Macron’s party, said Tuesday. “There is a middle way between those for whom nothing is good enough and those who don’t want to do anything.”<br />Tuesday’s bill must be reconciled with a text that has yet to pass the French Senate before it can become law."
