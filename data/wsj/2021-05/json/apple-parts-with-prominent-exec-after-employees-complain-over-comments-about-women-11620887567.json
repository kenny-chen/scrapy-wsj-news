    "body": "Apple Inc.  parted ways with a prominent advertising-technology executive weeks after hiring him, following complaints about sexist and misogynistic passages in a memoir he wrote about his time at  Facebook Inc.<br />Antonio García Martínez, who wrote the book “Chaos Monkeys” about his experience working at Facebook, is no longer with Apple, a spokesman said late Wednesday. Apple didn’t disclose more details about his departure.<br />“At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted,” an Apple spokesman said. “Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here.”<br />Mr. García Martínez didn’t respond to multiple messages seeking comment late Wednesday. A LinkedIn page for him listed him as working in “Product Engineering, Ads Platforms” at Apple, and says he started there last month.<br />Apple has largely avoided the sort of public controversy among employees over issues of gender and race that have shaken other big tech companies in recent years. Chief Executive Tim Cook has made it a pillar of his leadership at the company to publicly champion diversity and equality."
