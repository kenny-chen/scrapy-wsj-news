    "body": "A Minnesota judge has ruled that the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd can receive an aggravated prison sentence, allowing for one tougher than recommended by state guidelines.<br />In a decision dated Tuesday, Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over the trial of Derek Chauvin, held that the former officer abused his position of authority and treated Mr. Floyd with particular cruelty, among other factors he found supporting a tougher sentence.<br />A state jury last month convicted Mr. Chauvin of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the 2020 killing of Mr. Floyd, whose death sparked nationwide protests.<br />The case was largely built around bystander video that showed Mr. Floyd handcuffed facedown in the street and crying for help until passing out as Mr. Chauvin knelt on his neck and back for more than nine minutes.<br />The most serious charge against Mr. Chauvin was second-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 40 years. Minnesotaâ€™s sentencing guidelines recommend a sentence of up to 15 years for someone like Mr. Chauvin who had no previous felony arrests."
