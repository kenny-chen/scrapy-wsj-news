    "body": "ROME—The global policy trend of heavy fiscal stimulus, led by the U.S., faces a test case in Southern Europe.<br />Italy, Greece and Spain, hit hard in Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis a decade ago, are once again running big budget deficits and planning to spend on a grand scale to revamp their economies.<br />Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and other leaders in the region are betting that ambitious investments can give a lasting boost to growth. If the gamble doesn’t work, these countries will be saddled with some of the world’s highest debt ratios, potentially destabilizing the eurozone.<br />After years of running tight budgets with little room for transformative investments, they now see a once-in-a-generation chance to revitalize their economies.<br />Mr. Draghi, presenting his plans to Italy’s Parliament, said they contain not just a list of public works but “the destiny of the country.”"
