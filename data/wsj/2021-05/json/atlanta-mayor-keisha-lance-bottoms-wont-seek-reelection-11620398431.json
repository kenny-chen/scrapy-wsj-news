    "body": "ATLANTA—Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she wouldn’t seek a second term, an election-year surprise that marks a sharp turnabout for the city’s second Black woman executive, who months ago was among those President Biden considered for his running mate.<br />Ms. Bottoms, 51 years old, disclosed her decision publicly in a lengthy open letter and accompanying video Thursday night after having told family and a close circle of associates and supporters.<br />“It is with deep emotions that I hold my head high and choose not to seek another term as mayor,” Ms. Bottoms wrote, saying she had prayed about the decision with her husband, Derek, an executive at  Home Depot Inc.<br />The mayor is expected to speak publicly Friday morning.<br />Ms. Bottoms, who narrowly won a runoff election four years ago, pushed back against any questions about whether she could have secured a second victory later this year. She noted a re-election fundraiser she held with Mr. Biden’s support and said polls showed her in a strong position."
