    "body": "Employees are getting ready to jump to new jobs. What if you’re the one they’re leaving behind?<br />Just over a quarter of workers plan to look for a role with a different employer once the threat of the pandemic dissipates, according to a March survey of 2,000 workers by insurer Prudential. Managers will be left to deal with the aftermath. If one of your reports approaches you with a rival offer, or news they’re on the way out, do you fight to keep them? And what might persuade them to stay?<br />Many workers spent 2020 feeling frozen in place. With everything from child care to health tainted by uncertainty, it seemed prudent to stay put if you were lucky enough to have a stable job.<br />“Most people have just tolerated things that aren’t perfect,” Ravi Raman, an executive coach in Minneapolis, says of his clients. “There’s a lot of pressure getting built up in the system.”<br />Employees are now ready to leave behind the usual culprits: bad bosses, untenable workloads, skimpy paychecks. But managers also must contend with new desires and priorities sparked by the pandemic. In the Prudential survey, 42% percent of workers currently working remotely said if their employer didn’t make the option permanent, they’d find one that did."
