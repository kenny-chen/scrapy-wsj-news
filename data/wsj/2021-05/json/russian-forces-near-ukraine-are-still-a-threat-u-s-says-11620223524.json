    "body": "Russia has kept a heightened military presence near the Ukrainian border despite announcing the withdrawal of the troops it deployed last month, the U.S. and its NATO allies said, leading to concerns in Washington about Moscow’s intentions.<br />Russia’s military buildup, which it says was for defensive exercises, sparked concerns of a repeat of Moscow’s invasions of Ukraine in 2014, which severely damaged its relations with the West. Moscow announced a pullback late last month but has since withdrawn only some troops and equipment, a U.S. official said.<br />The continued heavy Russia military presence near Ukraine’s borders and in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, maintains pressure on an ex-Soviet neighbor that Moscow considers part of its sphere of influence. It also raises the stakes for Western efforts to bring Ukraine closer to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.<br />U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to arrive in Ukraine on Wednesday in a show of support.<br />“If Russia chooses to act recklessly or aggressively, we’ll respond,” Mr. Blinken told a news conference Monday at a meeting in London of top diplomats from the Group of Seven leading industrialized democracies. “But we’re not looking to escalate.”"
